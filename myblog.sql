(123, 18, 20, 'A Life Lesson from Learning to Swim', 'a-life-lesson-from-learning-to-swim', '&lt;p&gt;I went swimming today. Or rather I went to the pool and played in the water. I don&rsquo;t yet know how to swim despite having made it my goal to learn the skill two years ago. Today was the first time I entered the pool since that time and I had to wear a circular balloon around my ribs to prevent myself from drowning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going to the pool was extremely uncomfortable for me. As usual, I did my very best to dissuade myself from going:&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Is it necessary? If you don&rsquo;t go will you die? Is swimming really worth risking your life over? That pool has no lifeguards, remember?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am learning to tune this voice out. In the past, I have always had to wrestle with such internal objections whenever I made plans to go out for any leisurely activity. But usually, when I go out I end up having a fabulous time. Even though today wasn&rsquo;t exactly fabulous, it did exceed my expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I stepped into the pool the water and the balloon about my ribs felt treacherous. In the first 15 minutes or so, it felt like a silly idea to have come in the first place. I could barely move in the water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Never having consumed any material on how to swim, the first thing I did was paddle furiously with hands and feet, hoping that my ferocity would make up for my lack of skill and coordination. Here&rsquo;s how this worked out for me:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beating haphazardly against the water did actually move me forward a little bit, but this did not help because it also moved me backward. The same current that propelled me forward also tossed me back. For every 50 centimeters I gained in the forward direction, the water pushed me back another 40 centimeters, leaving me with only 10 centimeters gained for all my hard work; and even the 10 centimeters would not be in the right direction; so I often found myself starting at one end of the pool and ending up at one of the sides when I had been aiming for the other end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a few minutes of pointless paddling, I paused a moment and tried to apply some sense. Clearly, speed and ferocity were not working. I also noticed that I was swimming with my body and not with my mind. Lastly, I wasn&rsquo;t listening to the water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I went so far as to reflect on how fishes swim. Most fishes seem to just glide through the water with hardly a fin moving. Their body seems to be so in tune with the water that simple muscle contraction and relaxation suffices to propel them through the water. The reason I was constantly sliding backward was that I didn&rsquo;t have any rhythm to my movements. I just pushed the water forward and backward almost simultaneously and expected it to move me only forward. I needed to&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;listen&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;to the water. A rhythm is set up when I move the water the first time; my subsequent movements needed to follow that rhythm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was trying out these new ideas as I thought them and found that I was making some progress. Finally, I decided to turn over and swim backward with my back against the water instead of my belly. This was a stroke of genius. It made swimming incredibly easy. My hands and legs could easily achieve some synchronization in this position. I know I won&rsquo;t always have to swim in this position but it was a good start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would place my legs in an open diamond shape with my hands spread in a V-shape on either side of my head. Then I&rsquo;d push my feet into a straight position while at the same time paddling my hands down to my sides. My body would then assume a horizontally straight position, allowing me to easily move in the water. I would stay that way until I perceived my speed diminishing, at which point I would give another paddle again. I think that&rsquo;s how the jellyfish moves in the water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of an hour, I was impressed with the progress. The balloon was still wrapped around my chest of course, and I&rsquo;m sure if I had removed it at any point, I would have sunk to the bottom like a rock. But the fact that I was able to paddle and move in the direction&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt;&nbsp;determined was a good start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I learned a life lesson in that pool. Too often, we are so engrossed in our strive for results that we forget to even pay attention to the process much less enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I want to experience life as I go through it; I want to experience it in all its shades; the pleasant experiences and the not so pleasant but inevitable experiences&hellip;I want to experience them all for what they are. I don&rsquo;t want to gaslight myself. I don&rsquo;t want to live in denial. I don&rsquo;t want to engage in some frantic struggle or a mighty but futile effort just to give myself the impression that I am making progress when in reality I&rsquo;m only avoiding certain unpleasant truths I need to face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes some experiences are necessary for the lessons they will teach you. And sometimes, the pieces of our lives are so arranged that without needing help from an external party, we can turn our lives around radically for the better if we would only pause and give it some careful thought. That is all I needed to be able to swim on my first day without an instructor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have known many staunch individuals who regard activities like swimming, working out, singing, dancing, reading fiction, e.t.c as purely juvenile indulgences. But life is so intricately connected that you can learn about engineering, medicine, and so on from swimming or dancing or writing; perhaps not directly but your sense of rhythm, pattern recognition, poise, general keenness to details, etc will sharpen thereby making you a better engineer or doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like the Polymath, Leonardo da Vinci once said: &ldquo;Learn how to see. Realize that everything connects to everything else.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading!&lt;/p&gt;', 'second-post_1636205531.jpeg', 1, 1, '2021-06-14 16:08:07', '2022-03-08 09:29:27', NULL),
(124, 19, 23, 'On Writing and Life Experiences', 'on-writing-and-life-experiences', '&lt;p&gt;10:00 pm. Sunday night. I am lying on my back, my head propped up on a pillow. My knees are folded and my laptop rests on my lap. I need to write something before I sleep; also, whatever I write needs to be published.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ten minutes go by. Nothing to write. Another ten minutes. Nothing. The empty page seems to be taunting me. I think up a few ideas but all of them either require deep introspection or some research. I have no strength for either right now. I just want to write something simple and beautiful that comes naturally so I can go to sleep as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I decide to write a journal entry. That should do the trick: all that is required is a simple recount of my day (or my weekend). Nothing in the world could be easier, I tell myself. I know I am right, but I just can&rsquo;t shake off the feeling that I only want to publish something I believe is worth reading. My weekend was pretty ordinary. Nothing peculiar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;10:13 pm. Monday night. Sitting at my home workspace but I&rsquo;ve already closed work for today. I am listening to an official soundtrack of the one movie I remember that actually brought me to tears. I&rsquo;m also texting my friend. I know I probably shouldn&rsquo;t multitask when I am engaged in such a creative task as writing, but this is a journal entry, and so so far from being a distraction, it actually gives me something to write about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I could only get 3 paragraphs out. Three paragraphs in 1 hour. That&rsquo;s actually not bad. Most writers I know usually start with something called a first draft, and then they begin the first of many rounds of editing. That is the one piece of advice about writing that I have never really taken. I prefer to perfect a paragraph before moving to the next. It&rsquo;s probably why I&rsquo;m so slow. Perfectionism. I publish one article per month and I consider myself prolific hahaha. Oh, the joys of being an amateur! I can do absolutely anything I want.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talking about writing advice, another prominent piece of advice I&rsquo;ve often heard is that in order to be a better writer, one should broaden the scope of one&rsquo;s life experiences in general. So yesterday when I couldn&rsquo;t think of anything to write in almost thirty minutes of reflection, I began to feel that my life might be blander than I realized. I began to have fantasies of travel for the sole purpose of experiencing new places and cultures. Living in two cities that are different from the one you&rsquo;ve spent the better part of your life in, even for just a year, is probably better than an entire year of school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&rsquo;s 11:13 pm now and I&rsquo;ve added another 3 paragraphs. This seems like a good place to stop. I need to sleep early so that I wake up with all the energy I need for the day&rsquo;s work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading!&lt;/p&gt;', 'third-article_1627763881.jpeg', 1, 1, '2021-06-15 21:18:25', '2021-11-06 11:01:32', NULL),

(126, 19, 21, 'A Random entry in my Diary', 'a-random-entry-in-my-diary', '&lt;p&gt;Sunday evenings are for journaling. It is 9:40 pm now. I am lying face up in bed with my laptop hoisted on a laptop stand my brother bought a few months ago. This is usually the time of the week where I write something in my diary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, instead of writing in a place where only I can&nbsp;access it, I decided to write something I could share with anyone who cares to read it. A diary, they say, is a place where you pour out your heart and divulge the most delicate facts and secrets about yourself without fear of someone ever reading it. It is like having a conversation with a friend who will listen to everything you have to say and not judge you; someone whose faithfulness is absolute, and whose trust you can vouch for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You might be worried that I will ask this of you, dear reader, seeing as you are reading one of my diary entries. But fear not; I am going to apply a strict filter. So you don&rsquo;t have to worry about being caught in a tangle of secrets or anything like that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that we&rsquo;ve gotten that out of the way, shall we proceed?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I just came back from accompanying my friend for a photo shoot. It was about an hour\'s drive to the location, which explains why I&rsquo;m so tired. But the journey was quite pleasant. The photoshoot was a great success. The next time we go, he would be accompanying me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I love the rainy season so much, especially the first 2 months. The first rains sweep off all dust and waste from surfaces, leaving everywhere clean and sparkling, but without the mud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can you relate to this, reader, or is it just me? Life tastes better in the rainy season, don&rsquo;t you think? My appetite is usually keener. Sleep is sweeter. Reading a good book to the accompaniment of a heavy downpour is a taste of heaven. Above all, I love how I seem to sparkle and glitter all over without even trying. Even my very heart, I have noticed, is more sensitive in the rainy season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rain also brings back memories of the sweetest kind. Memories made all the more beautiful by the softening haze of time. That blessed period of childhood! Did you ever play in the rain when you were little? If you did, then you know what I&rsquo;m talking about. I need not say more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monday looms. What a short weekend this has been. I wish I had another day. Work was hectic last week. I learned so much though &mdash; from colleagues who are decades ahead of me in experience. I consider it a privilege.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&rsquo;m afraid I have to end here. This has been a most fragmented entry, touching on a few very random areas. I guess we can blame it on the filter that wouldn&rsquo;t permit me to dig deeper on any one story. Hope it made sense all the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I declare that I will wake up tomorrow bursting with energy and passion to start the new week. Lines will fall for me in the right places this week. I will go to bed with a deep feeling of fulfillment each night. And when I sleep, God will bless the work I did during the day and renew my strength and impart me with divine creativity, transformative ideas, and wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If that is what you desire, then it is my prayer for you too. Have a splendid week ahead!&lt;/p&gt;', 'fifth_1636205950.jpeg', 1, 9, '2021-06-15 21:20:34', '2021-11-06 12:39:10', NULL),

After that, I took a bath, fell in bed, hugged a pillow, closed my eyes, and waited for sleep to take over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But sleep was a long time coming. While I waited impatiently for sleep, my attention was drawn to the pains I felt in my core. I&rsquo;d been sitting at my laptop all day. It is more tiring than one might think. Sometimes I crave a job where there&rsquo;s more physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I lay in&nbsp;bed feeling my backbone ache, a string of words flashed through my mind. They seemed to be the utterances of my body rather than my mind. Here are the words:&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;I&rsquo;ve used up all my strength and there&rsquo;s nothing left to give.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I recognize those words! They come from an old song. The last time I listened to it was probably 4 years ago. This remembrance felt like an unexpected reunion with an old friend, so I decided to grab my laptop once more and write this so that my old song isn&rsquo;t lost to memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are the lyrics of a few verses in the song:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;I&rsquo;m at a loss for words, there&rsquo;s nothing to say&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;I sit in silence wondering what led me to this place&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;How did my heart become so lifeless and cold&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Where did the passion go?&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;When all my efforts seem like chasing the wind&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;I&rsquo;ve used up all my strength and there&rsquo;s nothing left to give&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;I&rsquo;ve lost the feeling and I&rsquo;m numb to the core&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;I can&rsquo;t fake it anymore.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;You speak and all creation falls to its knees&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;You raise Your hand and calm the waves of the raging sea&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;You have a way of turning winter to spring&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Make something beautiful out of all this suffering&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lyrics are too melancholic for my liking but one cannot deny that they are really poetic. You can search for &ldquo;Resurrection by Nicol Sponberg&rdquo; to see the full lyrics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&rsquo;s late now and I&rsquo;m tired. I only wrote this short piece because no matter what there will always be strength left to write. That is where the passion went (to answer the question in the first verse of the lyrics), and by writing this I am reaching out to grab it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I will read this article again tomorrow morning just to make sure tiredness didn&rsquo;t make me write nonsense hahaha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am happy that the next two days are holidays, so I&rsquo;m going to have time for some good rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let me sleep now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading!&lt;/p&gt;', 'eighth_1636205715.jpeg', 1, 0, '2021-06-15 21:21:50', '2021-11-06 12:35:55', NULL),

This is a lamentation for a dream that impostor syndrome is slowly estranging me from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The blinking cursor on a blank page still sends shafts of terror through my heart with each blink. I don&rsquo;t write with the frequency with which I&rsquo;d love to write and I tell myself the reason for that is because I don&rsquo;t have much free time, but deep inside I know that that is not altogether true. It is mostly just an excuse to keep the fear at bay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ever since I started writing for an audience, I have grown ever so anxious that I should not at any point be perceived as regressing in skill or creativity. I find myself always expecting that anything I write should surpass everything else I have ever written in quality and acclaim. Alas, this is a recipe for discouragement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we focus too much on our past accomplishments, we begin to get this illusion that we are good. This is dangerous because one who is already good has very little motivation if any to become better. And it is absolutely necessary to become better. Our very survival as individuals and as a race depends on it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At times, we dwell on our past glories without even realizing it. When we do this long enough, we soon find ourselves in the grip of a paralyzing reluctance to take any action towards our goals because we fear that taking action could lead to poorer results, thereby making our past achievements seem inauthentic or the product of mere luck. This is the most insidious form of impostor syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you do something good, normally you should feel encouraged to do more of such things, not sit back and admire it. If you enjoyed it and excelled at it the first time, and you suddenly start feeling reluctant to do it again, then it is probably Impostor Syndrome. Don&rsquo;t allow yourself to rationalize your inaction. Don&rsquo;t try to outsmart your brain. Just call it for what it is and take appropriate action to overcome it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And now for the million-dollar question&hellip; How do we overcome Impostor Syndrome? Here&rsquo;s my recommendation:&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Burn everything to the ground and start all over again.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metaphorically of course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The thing is, you should not allow yourself or your audience to put you on a pedestal, even if it is a good one. Burn that pedestal to the ground, and then when you start over again you could be anything, including something far better than what you have ever been before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fundamentally, we are human beings. It is not possible for us to sustain a certain level of mastery indefinitely. If it seems we are sustaining it, then it is not really as cool as we make it out to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So if you&rsquo;re a writer, don&rsquo;t stop writing simply because you&rsquo;re afraid it won&rsquo;t be able to produce something better. If you&rsquo;re a designer, don&rsquo;t stop designing; if an architect, don&rsquo;t stop architecting. Value only your effort and dedication, not just the result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If at any point you think you have fallen below your level of competence, just tell yourself you are burning it down to start again. It will be better, I promise. Just keep at it with all the dedication you can muster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading!&lt;/p&gt;', 'in-the-grip-of-impostor-syndrome_1636203429.jpeg', 1, 1, '2021-06-15 21:22:23', '2021-11-06 11:57:09', NULL),

(139, 19, 19, 'Looking Back on 12 months of Writing', 'looking-back-on-12-months-of-writing', '&lt;p&gt;I published one article for every month in the year 2020. That&rsquo;s 12 articles. It doesn&rsquo;t seem like much but it has been a thrilling ride for me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many things that make me happy and writing is one of them. The thing is, the actual process of writing can be arduous and even intimidating &mdash; for me at least. It requires patience, persistence, consistency, and courage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For every one of the articles I wrote this year, I had to call forth a certain combination of all of these values.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It took patience to make time out of my busy and distracted schedule to write. It took persistence to keep on writing even when my ideas began to feel all jumbled up and confused. I believe consistency to be key, so I committed to doing it once every month without fail for 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Putting my life experiences, thoughts, and ideas out there &mdash; especially for someone as reserved as me &mdash; took some courage because I knew I might come across as quirky or even stupid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But then again, I did not start writing because I believed myself wise enough to offer any kind of wisdom that my potential readers do not already possess. Neither did I start writing because I believed myself a good writer. The wisdom and the skill are merely aspirations while the commitment to writing consistently is just my way of striving to attain these aspirations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, I write because I want to become wiser. I write because I want to improve on my skill as a writer. I write because I hope that one day someone will be inspired by the things I write.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have learned that it doesn&rsquo;t take a genius to inspire someone. You don&rsquo;t necessarily have to be super smart or talented to inspire someone. I believe every human being has immense potential of which even&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt;&nbsp;are not often aware; and sometimes all it takes for them to realize this potential is for them to see you or some other person doing a clumsy job at something and then they go, &ldquo;Oh, I could write something better than this.&rdquo; Or, &ldquo;this is actually not as hard as I thought.&rdquo; Or, &ldquo;I have always wanted to do this but always felt shy but here&rsquo;s someone who is doing it with confidence and grace. I guess it&rsquo;s not as quirky a thing to do as I thought.&rdquo; And then they are inspired to take action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have been blessed with consciousness, intelligence and imagination; and yet, most of us explore very little of it. I believe my world to be a lot vaster than the tangible things that surround me everyday, and I mean to explore as much of it as my time will allow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almost every time when I sit down to write, I almost always find myself uncovering new ideas I never knew I had and encountering many I&rsquo;ve-never-thought-of-it-that-way moments during the writing process. These are the moments when the horizon of my experience, skill, imagination, intelligence and mental capacity are pushed further. It is along these lines that the real personal growth and intellectual maturity are forged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reading does this too. It goes without saying that in order to be a good writer, you have to be an avid reader of books; and read I did last year; I was particularly meticulous about reading, but that is a subject for another day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&rsquo;s a quote I remember reading. I don&rsquo;t know the author but it goes something like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;&ldquo;Write a life worth living and live a life worth writing about.&rdquo; &mdash; Unknown&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are the kind of quotes that get me out of bed with a spring. Sometimes it gives me just the little extra push that I need to do something worthwhile. I believe that is how this war we call life should be waged; we have to take it one day at a time. We have to value the little efforts because, in the end, they add up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I want to write something fascinating. I also want to live a story that would be so cool to write about. This is a classic one-hand-washes-the-other scenario, and writing is the thing that makes this possible. So I will continue this habit of writing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are my top 3 favorite articles from 2020:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://pieceofadvice.org/posts/a-tribute-to-the-friends-of-my-boyhood-days&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; style=&quot;color: inherit;&quot;&gt;A Tribute to the Friends of my Boyhood Days&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://pieceofadvice.org/posts/a-weekend-at-the-beach&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; style=&quot;color: inherit;&quot;&gt;A weekend at the Beach&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://pieceofadvice.org/posts/defining-moments&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; style=&quot;color: inherit;&quot;&gt;Defining Moments&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading!&lt;/p&gt;', 'looking-back-on-12-months-of-writing.jpeg', 1, 0, '2021-07-20 02:25:08', '2021-11-06 13:08:11', NULL),
(147, 19, 21, 'A weekend at the beach', 'a-weekend-at-the-beach', '&lt;p&gt;I am sitting on the balcony of a wooden cabin by the beach right now. It is 08:51 PM on Saturday; and yes, I&rsquo;m spending the night here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hear the waves crash in the distance. A soft breeze sighs through the trees in the yard below the cabin; it is rustling my dress and caressing my cheeks with a warmth that I will not soon forget. So soothing. So glorious beautiful!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This feeling brings to my mind a quote by Khalil Gibran that I like very much: &ldquo;The earth delights to feel your bare feet and the winds long to play with your hair.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am here with friends. We are seven in number. Two&nbsp;of&nbsp;my&nbsp;friends just&nbsp;went&nbsp;to&nbsp;check&nbsp;for&nbsp;something&nbsp;in&nbsp;the&nbsp;other&nbsp;quarters.&nbsp;The&nbsp;rest&nbsp;are having a chat inside the cabin. I, of course, am alone on the balcony. This is just how I want it to be for the next half hour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am sitting on a comfortable wooden chair with my feet ensconced on the table we had our lunch on hours before. I am spilling my thoughts out onto my phone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just in case you&rsquo;re wondering why on earth I would isolate myself to be writing nonsense at such a beautiful moment when I could be having the fun I came here to have, let me just answer you by saying that, first of all, this is not nonsense and secondly, I can&rsquo;t think of anything more beautiful to do right at this moment. And besides, I promised myself I would publish one article per month this year and tomorrow is already the last day of the month and I haven&rsquo;t written anything yet. It&rsquo;s been a wild, wild month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We&rsquo;ve engaged in a number of activities since we came. We&rsquo;ve played in the water. We played soccer in the sand. There has been music and dancing. We rode on those beach bikes that have 4 wheels. I know that&rsquo;s not their proper name but I can&rsquo;t remember it for the life of me. Don&rsquo;t ask me to look it up either, I am using a phone and it&rsquo;s stressful enough to type on the phone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We&rsquo;ve just been served grilled fish and a campfire is crackling in the yard below, waiting for us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are going down now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fire is big enough and warm. Almost too warm. I have to keep a distance. We&rsquo;ve brought the fish down by the campfire. There&rsquo;s wine too. I don&rsquo;t feel hungry right now. I don&rsquo;t eat much generally and it is not helping because I&rsquo;m so small and need to put on some weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I will pause here and eat first. And, I promise you, I will put the phone away and savor the moment. I don&rsquo;t want to have you think me a nerd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&rsquo;s been several hours since the paragraph before this one. As a matter of fact, it is 1:49 AM now on the following day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After we ate the grilled fish and had a sip of the wine by the campfire, our coordinator/organizer gave a little speech. After that, I opted to chip in a word or two about my experience so far and was granted an audience. I rambled for a few minutes about the activities of the day and ended with a word of gratitude and appreciation for such a beautiful moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Circumstances have torn us all apart before and we understand that moments like this are rare and fleeting, and so we would do our best to enjoy them as best we can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the speeches, we played a game of &ldquo;Never Have I.&quot; If you know this game, then you should already tell that some secrets were spilled. Not in a way that is harmful to anyone. Rather, in a way that made us all connect on a deeper level and air out things that have been burdensome to us for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the game, we went to the beach sometime around 1 AM and took a walk on the beach. The waves raged even more violently, their loudness enhanced by the silence of the night. It was both frightening and exciting to be at the beach in the middle of the night. Eventually, I felt I&rsquo;d had enough and so I, along with another friend of mine who shared the same feeling, came back to the cabin and I resumed writing again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I feel some pain in my waist and my muscles are sore from the workouts I&rsquo;ve done over this week. I don&rsquo;t know what a massage feels like but I think I need one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, thank you for reading my article. I think I should sleep now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cheers!&lt;/p&gt;', 'a-weekend-at-the-beach.jpg', 1, 1, '2021-07-20 02:25:57', '2021-11-06 12:27:06', NULL),
(306, 19, 27, 'Africa Bleeds', 'africa-bleeds', '&lt;p&gt;The most painful thing about the pain, the suffering, and the tragedies in Africa is that much of it can easily be avoided. Most of our leaders are at best incompetent. If that were where it ended, you probably wouldn&rsquo;t hear us complain about it much. But of course, it is a lot worse than that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within the last two months, I have heard a number of phrases that very succinctly describes the reality of the situation of most African countries. Here are some examples of such statements:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&ldquo;Do everything in your power to leave this country.&rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&ldquo;Just living in this Cameroon is already a full-time job.&rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&ldquo;Being a Nigerian is an extreme sport.&rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&ldquo;Please stay there, son. Don&rsquo;t come back to this country. As long as you are out of this country, we have peace of mind.&rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&ldquo;Nigeria will not end me&rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&nbsp;a Nigerian youth&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/O_Okee/status/1318898529428013057&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; style=&quot;color: inherit;&quot;&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;, and then a few hours after that he was killed in his own home during a protest that was supposed to be peaceful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&ldquo;My country has failed me.&rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&nbsp;This particular one has been the cry of a great many. If you know the individual stories behind this statement and some context around it, you wouldn&rsquo;t say it is entitled. It is a tragic statement. So far from doing anything good for its citizens, the country has failed simply to let them be; to live their lives in peace. Even as a law-abiding citizen, you have to live in constant terror of the bodies set up by the government to protect you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, Nigerian youths began a peaceful protest demanding an end to police brutality in Nigeria. It was one of the most inspiring displays of patriotism and solidarity I have ever seen. It made me believe that if Africa has any hope, it lies in the youths. It was peaceful and highly coordinated despite having no central leadership. To say that their demand was reasonable is an understatement: in essence, the youths were simply asking for their rights to live as human beings. They were asking the government to end the police unit called SARS that has constantly brutalized, extorted, and killed innocent youths over the years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And what did they get?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On October 20, 2020, at the protest ground in Leki, Lagos, Nigeria, some men said to be sent by the [Nigerian] government were seen&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIYqqSnxcuA&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; style=&quot;color: inherit;&quot;&gt;dismantling CCTV Security Cameras&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;at the Leki tollgate where the protesters were gathered. Soon after that, the street lights went off, and then soldiers opened fire on the protesters. It was being streamed live to all the world on social media, along with other clumsily executed atrocities by the government such as&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/oIYqqSnxcuA?t=244&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; style=&quot;color: inherit;&quot;&gt;hiring thugs and deploying them&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;in police cars to disperse the peaceful protest by violent means.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few days later, the president addressed the nation. He didn&rsquo;t mention the massacre at Leki. He paid no tribute to the fallen youths. Their lives were irrelevant and their cries for a right to live, a nuisance. At any rate, that&rsquo;s how I see it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The really sad thing about all of this is that I was surprised (but no doubt relieved) when calm was restored only a few days later. You see, I am a Cameroonian living and working in Nigeria. I witnessed a similar protest in my country nearly four years ago. It started very peacefully and graduated into full-on civil war. To this day innocent lives are still being lost. I thought the situation in Nigeria would not be different. Thank God I was wrong. Or maybe this was just one of those miraculous occasions where things don&rsquo;t escalate into something worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am even mildly surprised when I see Nigerians call out their leaders to account for their actions in these situations. At one point during the earlier stages of the protests in Cameroon, I grew scared of speaking out (online or offline) on the violence that was plaguing us because I feared I might get arrested or even killed for doing so. I had seen enough people get arrested, often in mass, and detained for no apparent reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It surprises me when I meet people and they have absolutely no idea that there is a serious crisis going on in Cameroon. It&rsquo;s been 4 years now. Countless people have lost their lives. Families have been torn apart. Homes have been burned to the ground and tens (if not hundreds) of thousands have lost their means of livelihood as a result. There has been a mass exodus to the bigger cities that are considered to be relatively safer. Even in those cities, the people have lived in perpetual fear all these years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the crisis began, we had shreds of hope when we saw the issue being broadcasted to the world on the major news outlets. We grew cheerful and even optimistic when the matter got to the United Nations. We would tell ourselves that it won&rsquo;t be long before justice is served and peace restored; that the UN would soon intervene and the killings would end. But the killings persisted. To this day there is no end in sight. People are still being killed. Innocent people. Children no older than 14.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just last week, a group of unidentified gunmen bursts into a school in one of the cities in Cameroon,&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumba_school_massacre#:~:text=With%20machetes%20and%20guns%2C%20they,12%20and%2014%20years%20old.&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; style=&quot;color: inherit;&quot;&gt;killing 7 kids&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;and leaving about 13 injured. The kids who died were between ages 12 and 14. Those are just the facts. The stories behind these deaths are even more tragic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the kids, Victor, was a 10-year-old son of a woman who had struggled with childlessness for 10 years. It had taken her 10 years of hoping and fighting and praying for a child. She was finally blessed with one. I imagine she must have treasured him as her most prized gift for the 10 years that she watched him grow. Then one day he was killed simply because she let him go to school to get an education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also heard that 3 of the kids who died were siblings. Their mother died a few days later, presumably of a broken heart. Today has been declared a national day of mourning for the kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We mourn for the kids and we don&rsquo;t even know the perpetrators yet and we don&rsquo;t know if and where they plan to strike next. There have been speculations concerning the perpetrators of this act but I think the point that everybody agrees on is that these killings are the result of the ongoing socio-political crisis that has been going on for 4 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have written about Nigeria and Cameroon because I have lived in these places and have something to say about them. I have heard horrific tales of human trafficking, child slavery, rapings, and more in many other parts of Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All this is largely the result of poor leadership&hellip;of dishonesty, corruption, embezzlement, incompetence, wickedness, a lust for power, and a monstrous greed that is peculiar to most African leaders. Our leaders are not accountable for their actions. It feels like we are entirely at the mercy of the powers that be. And what is even sadder is that these atrocities can be made known to the rest of the world and there is virtually nothing that the world can do to stop this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can feel optimistic when times are hard and when there is hunger and unemployment and all, but when a large proportion of the population stops receiving a proper education under a conducive environment, as is the case in Cameroon now, I begin to worry that this only translates and postpones the problems we are already facing.&lt;/p&gt;', 'a-ldf-scom_1636233796.jpeg', 1, 0, '2021-07-20 03:15:46', '2021-11-06 20:23:16', NULL),

(314, 19, 20, 'One day we will be Happy and Free', 'one-day-we-will-be-happy-and-free', '&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I like to listen to instrumental music while I am doing light work on my computer. This could be anything ranging from soft piano instrumentals to upbeat Celtic-, fantasy-, or medieval-themed music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such music usually gives a sort of rhythm to my thoughts without being a distraction. I listened to one recently, and, being the curious person that I am, I decided to go through the comments for that video on YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a piano instrumental titled &ldquo;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjjBK3ZV6jg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; style=&quot;color: inherit;&quot;&gt;One day&lt;/a&gt;&rdquo;, and one commenter wrote this short piece of&hellip;poem? Lyric? I&rsquo;m not sure what to call it, but it stroke a chord within me for some reason:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;one day I will get what I wanted for so long&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;one day we will be together&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;one day I swear everything will be better. It will be fine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;one day we will both be awake&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another commenter on this same instrumental wrote a short piece that is very similar:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;one day i will say the words i have silenced for so long&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;one day i will take a deep breath and fall asleep&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;one day i will be free&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;These words are beautiful in a way that is hard for me to describe. At first glance, they evoke feelings of hope, anticipation, desire, possibility, &mdash; a promise of better days ahead of us and a reassurance that our struggles of the present are setting us up for a brighter future; that one day we will look back and it will all have been worth it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, in the context of achieving our goals and dreams, motivational gurus would have us believe that &lsquo;one day&rsquo; is the language of losers &mdash; the anthem of procrastinators who would rather wish and daydream their life away in delusions of future grandeur instead of taking tangible actions&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;today&lt;/em&gt;&nbsp;in pursuit of those dreams. I believe that in many ways, this perspective of the above texts is right more often than not, and that&rsquo;s very sad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is this latter perspective of the above texts that gives them a kind of melancholic sheen. There is something inherently sad about deeply longing for something. But the above texts strike me as particularly melancholic not simply because they express a deep longing for something, but because the things longed for seem to be so modest and noble and very essential for any life that we would generally deem desirable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we decide to look at these words from either one perspective or the other (not both), we might be looking at it wrong. It is a good thing when we take action and they lead us on to achieve our dreams. It is also a good thing to hang on during trying times while hoping that things will improve. During such times, it is Hope that usually keeps some people going &mdash; the Hope that &ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;one day&rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&nbsp;they will be&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;awake&lt;/em&gt;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;together&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt;&nbsp;free,&lt;/em&gt;&nbsp;and that things will be&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt;&nbsp;and they will be&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;asleep&lt;/em&gt;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;fine&lt;/em&gt;. Or whatever the hopes may be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A line from the song&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;When You Believe&lt;/em&gt;&nbsp;says this of hope: &ldquo;Though hope is frail, it&rsquo;s hard to kill.&rdquo; In the above texts, we hear the voice of hope in every line. If hope is all you&rsquo;ve got, you&rsquo;ve got enough to get you through the storm. That is why I wrote this article. I think this quality doesn&rsquo;t usually get enough credit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;&ldquo;One day, in retrospect, the years of struggle will strike you as the most beautiful.&rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;&mdash; Sigmund Freud&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cheers!!!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PS: Now I invite you to compose a little piece using the &ldquo;One day&rdquo; phrase. This is an interesting prompt for you to find out your deepest longings.

(315, 19, 21, 'A Tribute to the Friends of my Boyhood Days', 'a-tribute-to-the-friends-of-my-boyhood-days', '&lt;p&gt;We were fierce rivals, sworn enemies, partners in crime, gossip buddies, playmates; and on our best days, we were all of that combined. Was there ever a better definition for Best Friends?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We were inseparable in those days, the three of us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You were the first person I met, Alex. It was on the morning of our first day as Form 2 students. I was new to the environment so when I came in class that morning, I chose a seat right at the back of the classroom even though I was among the shortest in the class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our&nbsp;first teacher decided to shuffle sitting positions to do justice to the heights of the likes of me. I packed my things and moved to the front as the teacher asked. I stood scanning all the seats in the front row, trying to decide where to sit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When our eyes locked, something about your eyes caught my attention. You gazed up at me from where you sat, your eyes shining with cuteness and innocence and kindness and friendship. You and I were about the same height. Your occiput rested on your back as long as mine but while mine was slender, yours was massive. Without uttering a word and with your gaze fixed on me, you gently tapped the empty spot on your bench, inviting me to sit with you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&rsquo;t remember our first conversation. I don&rsquo;t even remember saying thank you after sitting down. I probably never did. But how significant that moment feels now, looking back over a decade later. Who would have thought that we would grow to share so much of our lives together?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we&rsquo;d established some rapport, you told me you had a brother called Ransom in the other class. He and I would meet a few weeks after.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ransom, I can&rsquo;t paint an exact picture of our very first encounter but I know that when we met, we got along as if we had been old buddies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The years drew the three of us closer and closer together. By the third year of our meeting, we would have sleepovers often as once a week. By the fourth year, we were roommates. People had noticed us together in the neighborhood and on school campus so long that we soon garnered quite a bit of popularity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even at that time, we played too much for our ages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We were like three little clowns. Perpetrators of all kinds of mischief. We scuttled about the school campus like rats in an abandoned cathedral. I still remember the smell of chalk and dust on those afternoons we spent moving from one empty classroom to another after school hours, scribbling rubbish on the blackboards and jumping all over the benches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One day, in one of those empty classrooms, we wanted to see who could give the highest kick. Each of us would fling his leg as high in the air as he dared while the other two measured how high it went. When it was Alex&rsquo;s turn, he lifted his right leg high in the air. When it was halfway up, his left leg gave way under him. Then he came down with astonishing speed, like a log of wood flung at the ground, the back of his head hammering at the floor with a tremendous BANG!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We burst into explosive laughter, Ransom and I. We laughed like fools that day. I seriously thought my ribs were about to crack. And then, just as we&rsquo;d managed to catch a breath, you described to us how for an instant, you thought you had gone blind and could only see blackness and moving stars. This launched us into fresh bursts of laughter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A stranger would have thought this very rude of us but it is only expected behavior in our circle. Had it happened to Ransom or me, you would have laughed just as much or even more. We always did this to one another and had long since learned not to take it personally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you remember our crushes? How we vied for their attention. How we wanted so badly to share a seat with them; or simply to stand next to them on the assembly lines, shoulders touching. How we boasted to one another when one of our crushes so much as smiles at us; or returns our gaze; or laughs at our jokes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I say &ldquo;them&rdquo; because they were many and we seemed to discover new ones every month or so. Also, we seemed to have the exact same taste. When one person amongst the three of us was known to have a crush on a girl, whoever that girl is, the other two would automatically fall for her too; and thus would begin a new rivalry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We didn&rsquo;t joke when it came to food. Good food in the house was enough to make us boycott classes. We had no self-discipline when it came to food. We would blow away our allowances early in the month on rich food and snacks and then towards the end of the month we would scrounge for every meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We used to prepare queer meals too. For example, we would prepare soup by frying dried meat, dried fish, lots of mushrooms, and a shit ton of green spices consisting of celery, leeks, and onions, and then eat it with&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Garri&lt;/em&gt;&nbsp;or something like that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We were masters at coming up with nicknames. Do you remember&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Madam Arthropods&lt;/em&gt;?&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Prophet Jeru&lt;/em&gt;?&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Phytophthora Infestans&lt;/em&gt;?&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Liquid Metal&lt;/em&gt;?&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Antom&lt;/em&gt;? Do you remember how they all came about these nicknames?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like these derogatory nicknames, our sarcastic and mocking remarks never grew old either. Instead, they grew more amusing the more we used them. I remember a day you two mocked at me and I moved from feeling irritated to suppressing a laugh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leo Tolstoy once said, &ldquo;Every family is happy in its own way.&rdquo; We were not exactly family but this quote applies to us too. We were very happy but we were not without our quarrels and disagreements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our feuds were as petty as they were short-lived. I remember occasions where we would be right in the middle of a heated argument and then something funny would pop up or one of us would make an unintentionally funny remark and we would all burst out laughing, and that would be the end of our quarrel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of our quarrels were more serious and long-lasting. But we always found a way to patch things up in the end. Sometimes it felt like we had no choice but to make things work out between us. Like a couple who don&rsquo;t believe in divorce, it felt like we were bound together by both Fate and Destiny, and any attempt to separate was bound to fail or hurt even more than staying together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We created many fond memories together. We often promised ourselves that when we are all grown up, we would come together every once in a while to reminisce over all those wild experiences. But you two haven&rsquo;t delivered on your promises, have you?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a person we care about leaves this world, it feels to us as though it had been in their power to stay and they chose instead to leave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who will I reminisce with now? You know I love reminiscing very much. I love memories. When I look back at life, it is not the pain, the guilt, the fear, or the suffering that I see. Instead, I see beauty. I see Poetry. Growth. Change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So much has changed since your passing. The earth is behaving like a constipated stomach. Our land is soaking wet with the blood of the innocent. Trees are probably growing in our school where once there had been carpet grass. Schools have shut down by the hundreds in our country. A pandemic hits the world by the name of COVID-19. The same man still rules as our president. I don&rsquo;t want to bore you with any more of these stories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for me, I have grown so much sober these days. The stern demands of youth and the tragic blows of grief have knocked all wildness and free-spiritedness out of me. Do you know I lost another just after you two? Or was it before? I can&rsquo;t remember. The dates are fuzzy in my mind. But it couldn&rsquo;t have been more than two years apart and he left in just as ghastly a manner as you two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I read a quote by Gabriel Garc&iacute;&shy;a M&aacute;rquez that goes, &ldquo;No matter what, nobody can take away the dances you&rsquo;ve already had.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would like to leave you with this quote. We have had beautiful moments together and nothing can take that away from us. You two left too soon but maybe the short time you spent here was just enough according to God&rsquo;s plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will forever miss you. Continue to rest in peace in the bosom of our Lord, my friends. When I come we will take it from where we left off.&lt;/p&gt;', 'a-tribute-to-the-friends-of-my-boyhood-days_1636204964.jpeg', 1, 10, '2021-11-06 12:21:16', '2021-11-06 12:22:44', NULL),
(316, 19, 20, '2020: A Song of the Sorrows of the Sons of Men', '2020-a-song-of-the-sorrows-of-the-sons-of-men', '&lt;p&gt;I remember the hype. How we as a world celebrated the dawn of a new decade with such fervor. I mean, how could we not? Just look at the year: 2020. Something about the very number itself &mdash; the alternating pattern of digits, the semi-symmetry, the evenness, and even the fact that it is a leap year; How could we not fall for that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even the more cynical among us, I imagine, must have felt slightly auspicious about this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I believe there are&nbsp;seasons in life. Not simply the seasons that are determined by the weather or the position of our earth around the sun, I mean episodes in our lives in which we are beset by misfortune after misfortune or during which the stars seem to align themselves perpetually in our favor. Each of us seems to have our timelines for such seasons. This year has plunged many people into unprecedented depths of pain and sorrow but it has no doubt been the best year for some.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would therefore be unfair &mdash; even untrue &mdash; to say either that the year was good or bad. I doubt if there&rsquo;s anything like a good or bad year. The way I understand it, time is simply indifferent to the happenings of humankind. The clock simply ticks away and our world goes on rotating whether the earth be quaking or the storm raging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We would be nearer the truth if we say it is a year in which many bad things happened to our planet and to so many people. The year when the very air we share smelled of death and the sky was the color of blood and the heavens just couldn&rsquo;t get enough of the souls of men. It is the year in which I felt claustrophobic under the open sky. Never, in my experience, has our world felt so small or our race so powerless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that year is finally ending. I want to rejoice that it is ending. I want to feel hopeful and optimistic at the prospect of 2021. But I will not be so naive as to expect things to somehow magically turn around simply because 2020 has ended. The events of this year taught me better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As things began to worsen at the start of this year, I found myself more than once trying to convince myself that I had witnessed the worst of it.&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Surely, it can&rsquo;t possibly get worse than this?,&lt;/em&gt;&nbsp;I would tell myself. How cute! Almost immediately following this, as if in defiance of my naivete, another more terrible blow would be delivered. It felt like some variant of Murphy&rsquo;s law playing out on repeat: If you think things are bad, they can and will get worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes we think that times have changed when really we have merely garnered more experience with age and it is only our perspective of the world that has changed. I am usually inclined to believe that it is our perspective that has changed, probably because that way I relieve myself of the responsibility, even if only psychologically, of doing something to &ldquo;fix&rdquo; all that is bad about that change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the world as we know it is changing &mdash; as it should, for change is inevitable. The thing that should concern any person who cares is if that change is for the worst, as it has been for some years now. I will take the case of the crisis situation in Cameroon as an example, as I am both directly and indirectly affected by it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I look at the socio-political landscape of Cameroon over the past 4 years, I am besieged by grief as if over the loss of a loved one. The ongoing crisis has left the nation bruised and battered. Grief, pain, despair, sorrow, economic hardship, and hatred are festering, and on top of that fresh injuries are still being sustained as a result of the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglophone_Crisis&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; style=&quot;color: inherit;&quot;&gt;More than half a million&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;people have had to flee their homes and communities to seek refuge in other cities. Thousands have died and the number continues to increase. Over fifty thousand Cameroonians are in Nigeria as refugees. Hundreds of schools have remained closed for the past 4 years. Nelson Mandela once said that education is a powerful tool that we can use to change the world. When a large proportion of our population is not receiving an education, any sensible person should fear for our future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lessons of 2020 were many. I have learned so many lessons, most of them the hard way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Life does not owe us anything. Instead it is a gift. A very precious, fleeting gift. Life will not soften to accommodate our whims and desires. If we want some semblance of happiness, we have to create it ourselves; and you would be surprised at the kind of unusual places one can often find it. The very fact that you can find happiness, joy, peace, beauty in even the most turbulent of times is an indication that there is got to be more to life than meets the eye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am sure that if we allow ourselves to look past all the horrors of 2020, we would find that despite everything, there were aspects of the year that had their own rather twisted kind of beauty or at least that were worth remembering. Determining to continually shift and adjust our perspective of life to bring it the point where we can see that beauty in almost any situation is something we should continue to strive for. Waiting for situations to adjust can be futile, as 2020 has taught us. But we can adjust our perspective and that can make all the difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading and I wish you a Happy new year!&lt;/p&gt;', '2020-a-song-of-the-sorrows-of-the-sons-of-men_1636229211.jpeg', 1, 0, '2021-11-06 19:05:52', '2021-11-06 19:06:51', NULL),
(317, 19, 28, 'Should you ask this question on a first date?', 'should-you-ask-this-question-on-a-first-date', '&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Where do you see yourself in 5 years?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, my friend shared a video with me in which a lady was relating her first date experience with a guy.&nbsp;The guy had asked her on their first date what her plans were for the next five years and she was taken aback by this &ldquo;pettiness&rdquo; as she called it.&nbsp;According to her, this was totally inappropriate and it made her wonder if she was on a date or at a job interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She didn&rsquo;t let this&nbsp;slide. She retorted with her own question &mdash; she asked the guy what his retirement plans were. Of course, she wasn&rsquo;t really interested in the answer, she merely asked it as a sarcastic way to let the guy know that some questions, such as his question, are just not appropriate. Apparently, the guy took offense at this and that pretty much ended their date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After seeing the lady&rsquo;s video about this, the guy published his own video in response. He reasserted his stance on the matter and said that he saw nothing wrong with the question he&rsquo;d asked. He said he asked this question because he wouldn&rsquo;t date or marry a person who doesn&rsquo;t have a life plan or a sense of purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wanted to get other opinions on this matter so I posted it on my WhatsApp status and found that many of my friends saw no problem with the question. They agreed with the guy that they too would only date or marry a person who is purpose-driven and has a plan for their life. They emphasized that knowing this at the beginning is essential as it would help them decide whether to proceed or end the relationship at an early stage, thereby saving themselves the time and resources that might have to be expended on subsequent dates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few other friends expressed a different opinion. Like the girl, they felt it was not courteous to ask such a question on a first date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This disparity in opinions over this question reminded me once again that we humans are very different from one another in the way we think. A rude comment to one person can be received as a compliment by another person. Because of this, I don&rsquo;t suppose I am in the position to say who was right and who wrong. Nobody is. I think people are just different. I will merely state how I would interpret such a question if I were to be on the receiving end of it on a first date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To aid with my explanation, I am going to paint a hypothetical scenario. I am on a date with a lady and she asks me, &ldquo;Where do you see yourself in 5 years?&rdquo; A minute of silence ensues during which I lift my glass of iced fruit juice from the table between us with all the poise I can muster and draw a long sip. This gives me enough time to process her question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If she takes my silence to mean that I am thinking of a perfect answer to give her, she is mistaken. I am not thinking about the answer; I am thinking about the question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I recognize that question. It is a very old question and it is also very clich&eacute;. It is most popularly known for being used at job interviews to judge whether a candidate is a good fit for a position or not. Because of this, asking this question might make the person asking it seem slightly condescending or even rude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asking me this question immediately tells me that she very overtly wants to know if I am a good fit for her or not. She is evaluating me and makes no effort to conceal it. You&rsquo;ve got to presume yourself to have a kind of high ground over a person before you can ask them that kind of question. That is why I do not find it polite at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Come to think of it, this is our first date. Do you expect me to spill my plans for the future with somebody I am hanging out with for the first time?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We need to first build the foundations of trust. We need to be sure that we are comfortable around each other and that we find each other&rsquo;s company pleasant at least. We will need some time to verify again that the chemistry is there and we did not just whip it up in our imagination. This down-to-business approach on the first date suggests to me that she doesn&rsquo;t view any of that as important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I am not against having a kind of plan for your future. But this is just not the time and asking that question is just not the best way to find out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asking the question might actually prove to be ineffective. Even if I articulate an impressive vision of my life in 5 years, how can she tell if I&rsquo;m not just making a wish rather than saying something I&rsquo;m determined to work towards achieving? Having a plan for the future is important but what is more important is the qualities you embody in the present. Qualities like consistent effort, strategy, determination, persistence, perseverance, sound moral principles, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If someone had asked me 5 years ago what my plans were for the next 5 years, whatever answer I gave them would have been a lie. Sure, in my own vague way I had plans but if I had stuck with them, I would have settled for far less than was possible. Life in this fast-changing world can be full of fascinating twists and surprises and new opportunities. A plan for an imagined future might be important but what is even more important is the qualities you embody today and the values you live by here and now. Your 5-year plan might change, but who you are now and the values you live by will not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asking me that question actually raises suspicions in me: Is she interested in the person she is seeing before her right now or in the version of me that shall have achieved their dreams 5 years hence? If tomorrow I am the victim of some misfortune, and the plans I had shared with her fail to materialize, will she love me any less because of it? Will she tell me with disappointment that I have &ldquo;changed&rdquo; or that I am not the man she thought I was? Maybe my suspicions are false. Maybe they are not. But it would be best if she doesn&rsquo;t give me any reason to be suspicious at all. This is just another reason why it is probably a bad idea to ask that question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know some people would argue that asking this question will help them know if they are a suitable match or not. But I have already made an argument against this: it is not effective; there is very little you can tell about a potential partner by their answer to this question, and given the nature of the question and the potentially negative effects it might elicit on your date, it is not worth asking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The years don&rsquo;t go by in leaps of 5. Who I am in all the months, weeks, and days that make up 5 years is just as important if not more important than where I end up in 5 years. It would be more effective to check for values that a person can exercise here and now. You can know in just a few moments of being with a person if they are kind, smart, hardworking, committed, persevering, and so on, and based on this, you can safely guess if they are purpose-driven and if they have a bright future ahead of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Purpose is a journey. It is not a specific instance in the future. Sure, it can culminate in something; it can lead towards something, but the journey is just as important. That is why it is possible to live a purposeful life without necessarily having a clear picture of your life in 5 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, there is another way to look at this. She could have asked this question for any number of reasons. Maybe she asked this in an innocent attempt to keep the conversation going or to dispel an awkward silence. Maybe she was just nervous and some people, particularly me, say things that don&rsquo;t make sense even to&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;them&lt;/em&gt;&nbsp;when they are nervous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe asking the question doesn&rsquo;t say anything about her that I should be concerned about. Maybe she was not asking it to evaluate me or anything like what I&rsquo;ve said so far. On its own, the question might mean anything or nothing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So it might be too early to form any strong opinions about her on the basis of one question she asked. It is good to give people the benefit of doubt. It is only when you identify a sustained pattern of such quirkiness that you can make something serious of it and probably take appropriate action. e.g. talk about it with your date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like I said at the start, people are different. I have discussed this with friends and they seem to consider this question to be some sort of an effective pickup line for them. So if you feel like taking a risk, go right ahead and ask it. But you should know that you are moving on thin ice. The question is a dealbreaker for some people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To come back to my case, I think in the end I will probably answer her question just to be polite, but making sure I reveal only as much as I feel comfortable to reveal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would very much like to hear your thoughts on this. What do you think about this question? How would you feel being asked this question on your first date? Let me know in the comments below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading!&lt;/p&gt;', 'should-you-ask-this-question-on-a-first-date_1636233996.jpeg', 1, 0, '2021-11-06 20:25:00', '2021-11-06 20:26:50', NULL),
(318, 19, 21, 'Idle Thoughts of a Lazy Writer', 'idle-thoughts-of-a-lazy-writer', '&lt;p&gt;This article is not supposed to make any sense whatsoever. Well, actually it might make sense to you if you are feeling as lazy as I am as I write this. Having something you can relate to wouldn&rsquo;t come across as pure nonsense, would it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But you clearly are not lazy because it takes a considerable amount of will power and self-discipline to read an actual article these days. Most people just lounge on the couch or in bed and scroll through Instagram, YouTube, or Twitter for hours on end. I do not deny that I do a lot of that myself. Sometimes though, like on this particular occasion, I give myself the full freedom to be as lazy as I can possibly be, but only in a way that would actually benefit me in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here&rsquo;s what I mean by that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Writing is such a difficult task. It is not the sort of thing that a lazy person would pick to occupy their time with. But it passes as one of the most productive things a lazy person can do, even if they fail colossally at it. And that is why I chose to write right now instead of lounging in bed and watching a movie like I was doing a few minutes ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When such moments of intense laziness hit me; when I feel as though an enormous elephant is sitting on my chest and I cannot so much as lift a finger, I muster up the last traces of courage, will power and self-control within me and make myself a deal: I allow myself the freedom to abandon any form of work that I don&rsquo;t feel like doing at the moment and indulge myself in any activity that I prefer &mdash; on the condition that that activity is one that can profit me in the long run or at least wouldn&rsquo;t make my overall situation worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes this will entail just taking a nap, going out for a walk, eating some snacks or fruits, reading a book, or writing something in my journal. For me, the most frequent of these is reading. When my work starts to feel even slightly overwhelming, I just slam the laptop shut, fall in bed, and open the Kindle app on my phone and read a book. Almost every time after reading, I feel like I have done something productive. I feel like I am actually good for something. This makes me feel good about myself and the next thing I know, I am on my laptop again, slaying away at code as though it is the one thing I was born to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I feel like I am giving some sagely advice right now &mdash; advice about laziness, despite having just referred to myself as a lazy writer in the very title of this article. My advice might not be sagely but let&rsquo;s just pretend it is. This&nbsp;begs&nbsp;the&nbsp;question: Would you take advice on how to deal with laziness from a lazy person? Would you take weight loss advice from an overweight person?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back in the days when I didn&rsquo;t know better, I would say, without a&nbsp;thought, that I can&rsquo;t take weight loss advice from someone who is overweight or productivity advice from a lazy person. It just didn&rsquo;t make any sense. But now I think that is very shallow and it is not always the correct way to look at it. I think Friedrich Nietzsche explained this better than I ever could so I&lsquo;m just going to step back and let him speak on this one:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;There is a false saying, &lsquo;Whoever cannot save himself &mdash; how can he save others? &lsquo; But if I have the&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;key&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&nbsp;to your chains, why should your and my lock be the same.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;&mdash;&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Friedrich Nietzsche&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope that is a satisfactory explanation because I am too tired to work one up right now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few days ago I read somewhere that you don&rsquo;t have to be rich or famous or good looking to have an extraordinary life. Among many other things, you could create interesting habits and principles and follow them consistently and judiciously. I strongly agree with this and writing is one of my habits I try to&nbsp;cultivate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a matter of fact, what pushed me to write this article in the first place is the fact that this month is ending in a few hours and I need to fulfill a commitment I made to myself 8 months ago to publish one article a month. Do you see how a commitment that was made 8 months ago is still helping me to defeat laziness today? If I hadn&rsquo;t made that commitment, I don&rsquo;t know where I would have had the will power to stop a movie halfway to write an article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I started this article, I was exercising the laziness trick I just talked about. I knew I needed to write. I also knew that writing was difficult and I was in no mood to do anything difficult. So I decided to make it easier and possibly fun for me: I allowed myself the freedom to write anything at all. I didn&rsquo;t care about the quality of the article as long as I actually wrote it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It doesn&rsquo;t much matter to me whether or not the article turns out to be awful. It matters that I actually stared laziness in the face and went ahead in spite of it and wrote the article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the title of this article, I probably gave you the impression that I was going to share many thoughts but I just realized I&nbsp;have&nbsp;only&nbsp;shared&nbsp;one &mdash; about&nbsp;laziness. Before you accuse me of having lied about this, I would like to bring to your attention the fact that the opening statement of the article mentioned that it wasn&rsquo;t going to make any sense, so I guess we can say it all cancels out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I&rsquo;m just going to end here since I don&rsquo;t have any more thoughts to share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cheers :)&lt;/p&gt;', 'idle-thoughts-of-a-lazy-writer_1636234136.jpeg', 1, 0, '2021-11-06 20:28:35', '2021-11-06 20:28:56', NULL),
(319, 19, 25, 'Reading in a time of Corona Virus', 'reading-in-a-time-of-corona-virus', '&lt;p&gt;I read a lot these days. I rarely go out except to get food or take a walk in the neighborhood. My 1-hour-a-day commute to work is now a bonus time. The often unproductive chit chat I used to have with my colleagues in the office, while I miss those very dearly, I nonetheless appreciate the time saved by staying home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even for an introvert, I do not relish&nbsp;staying at home all day every day but I figured if I have no other choice, I might as well just find something to be grateful for, and that is the little extra time it saves me. I have scraped together such fragments of time and devoted it to voracious reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I like to think of myself as a slow reader. I take my time and I read as much to educate myself as to entertain myself. That is why I generally don&rsquo;t make it a habit to count the number of books I have read. Where is the fun in reading when you feel compelled to finish a certain number of books within a given time period? That is sort of thing school does and it is the reason why for most people, myself included, it was never fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&rsquo;t normally take notes when I read (Yes, I am lazy like that), but over the past couple of months, I have read three books and the ideas in them have struck me as potentially lifechanging, so I decided to take some notes this time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So these are my notes you&rsquo;re reading right now. Usually, I take notes in some diary or journal or on the margins of books but today I decided to write it in the form of an article. That way I can share it and fulfill the little commitment I made to myself 7 months ago to publish one article per month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I made a similar commitment last year in which I challenged myself to tick off one significant achievement per month and this seems to have worked really well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the years, I have learned countless times through personal experience and learning from others that being consistent is far more powerful than being intense. If you give a slow-moving stream enough time, it will eventually break through rock. Here&rsquo;s how James Clear put it in&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Atomic Habits&lt;/em&gt;: &ldquo;Changes that seem small and unimportant at first will compound into remarkable results if you&rsquo;re willing to stick with them for years&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, this is common knowledge but the strange thing is that we hardly put it into practice. Our attention span is limited. We want to see the results now. We have a tendency to postpone or write off anything that promises rewards several years hence. That is why in many ways success in any worthy endeavor is more often an act of faith. You have to believe in yourself and believe that things will work out well before you can put in the consistent effort that is required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you know what will happen if you read at least 30 minutes a day every single day for 5 years? Can you imagine what will happen if you consistently save and/or invest just 5% of your monthly income for 10 years? Do you know that working out on a regular basis can increase your happiness, boost your energy, and make you live longer? These tiny commitments over the long haul produce a compounded effect that is enormous and more than worth the sacrifice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is very much different from goals. James Clear refers to such commitments as systems. The way goals work is, you set a goal and you either achieve it or not. With systems, you just do the thing consistently. You make it a lifestyle. With goals, you have the potential to become successful. With systems, you&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt;&nbsp;a success. When you fail at a goal, you might set another goal or start all over again; sometimes some people even give up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With systems, success and failure are only steps along the way. They are just guideposts. When you fail you learn. When you succeed you learn. You take this as feedback and modify your systems accordingly to do more of what works and less of what doesn&rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scott Adams in his book,&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;kind of says the same thing: When you are starting out, try as many things as you can, do more of what works and less of what doesn&rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learn as much as you can. The more you know, the more you can know. Each new skill doubles your chances of success. Start with one skill, however easy it is, and be good at it. It will set in motion a chain of events that will catapult you to greater success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Associate yourself with the people who are already in the place where you want to be. Studies have shown that hanging around friends who are lean and fit can also make you fit and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to enhance the quality of your life, rearrange your life so that you can have more control over your schedule. Concentrate your energy on the one thing which when achieved will simplify or obliterate so many other issues in your life and give you the freedom you want.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it is okay to be selfish. The world needs you at your best. Learn to prioritize your needs when you feel you need to. Personal sacrifices for the sake of others is great. It is heroic. But keep in mind that the hero who dies today will not live to help more people tomorrow. You can help a lot more people by taking care of your own self first and keeping yourself healthy in mind, body, and spirit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;The most important form of selfishness involves spending time on your fitness, eating right, pursuing your career, and still spending quality time with your family and friends. &mdash; Scott Adams&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, never forget that sometimes the absolute best thing you can do for yourself is to help others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you want to be happy? Here&rsquo;s a formula Scott Adams suggests:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eat right. Exercise. Get enough sleep. Imagine an incredible future (even if you don&rsquo;t believe it). Work toward a flexible schedule. Do things you can steadily improve at. Help others (if you&rsquo;ve already helped yourself). Reduce daily decisions to routine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading ;)&lt;/p&gt;', 'reading-in-a-time-of-corona-virus_1636234787.jpeg', 1, 0, '2021-11-06 20:37:32', '2021-11-06 20:39:47', NULL);

(320, 19, 24, 'Defining Moments', 'defining-moments', '&lt;p&gt;It amazes me sometimes the kind of things I am still able to remember: Flashes from a past so distant it feels like a different lifetime. They come to me unbidden, like the stubborn tune of some random song.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I remember events from when I was 5 years old with remarkable vividness; events that are so inconsequential they might as well have never happened; and yet, I remember them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we go through life, things happen to us that shape the course of our lives; and yet, more often than not we fail to realize their impact until much later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I was in secondary school nearly 10 years ago, a senior who lived in the same hostel as I invited me over to take Math lessons from him one afternoon. He was sitting in a strategically conspicuous position so as to be visible to as many people in the hostel as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was not in the least interested in revising Math but out of respect for this senior, I went over to him for the lessons. My plan was to feign attention and interest until the whole ordeal was over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All the while that I was with him, he made it a point to lecture at the top of his voice, raising his head every now and again to glance around as though to make sure that people saw that he was actually teaching somebody maths. His real motive, it would seem, was not a genuine interest in getting me to understand Algebra. He merely wanted to be thought of as smart by all the other neighbors who were around that day; he was using me to achieve that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I didn&rsquo;t pick up on this at the time, of course. I just sat there obediently, watching him move&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt;&nbsp;around, negating the coefficient each time&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;&nbsp;or&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt;&nbsp;changed sides in the equation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has taken me nearly a decade to realize that that Math lesson I got from that senior is perhaps the most important lesson I ever had up until that point in my school life. This is genuinely not an exaggeration and I will tell you why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was a bit of a truant in my early years of secondary school (F2 &amp; F3). I boycotted classes for the silliest and laziest of excuses. If for instance I hadn&rsquo;t done a teacher&rsquo;s homework or didn&rsquo;t have all their notes from the previous lessons, that teacher wasn&rsquo;t going to see me in their class that day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the more lessons I missed, the more gaps I had in my understanding of the concepts that were being taught in my absence, and the more my confidence wavered. False assumptions soon set in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like the majority of people in secondary school, I was also vulnerable to&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;groupthink&lt;/em&gt;&nbsp;when it came to smartness and mediocrity: It was commonly assumed that the people who knew maths were the smart ones and the rest were just getting by. The mediocre students shared a common hatred for Maths and regarded high performing Math students as absolute brainiacs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I had always considered myself one of the mediocre students. I assumed that maths was difficult; that looking for the value of&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;x&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;in an equation was the stuff of nightmares and that it was a waste of effort to try to understand it. We used to even have a sort of slang about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This all changed after the revision session I had with my senior. The concepts he covered were super easy (he probably chose them because he wasn&rsquo;t confident enough to cover the slightly challenging ones) and the whole lesson of that day can be summarized in a single paragraph:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In a basic algebraic equation with one unknown, finding the answer simply entails moving all unknowns to one side of the equation and negating their coefficient. The rest is just basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simple and easy. I wondered why it had taken me so long to grasp something as easy as that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a startling realization for me; a paradigm shift; a change from a fixed mindset to a growth mindset. That lesson made me challenge my assumptions about Math and difficult subjects in general.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my subsequent math lessons in school, I actually paid attention to the lectures and was soon able to understand more challenging topics just as easily. Math became my favorite subject. My performance in other subjects soared. I soon secured a position among the top 3 students in the class for the rest of secondary and high school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The math lesson was a huge defining moment for me and it didn&rsquo;t even seem like it at the time. Just look at the highlights of the experience:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I found it boring and uninteresting&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It was fuelled by my senior&rsquo;s ego&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I didn&rsquo;t think it was important at the time&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much of our experiences in life are like this. The truly exciting, ecstatic moments are few and far between and are sometimes forgotten the moment we finish experiencing them. On the other hand, the dull, tasteless, ordinary, grinding routines of everyday life such as work fill up the majority of our days; and yet they are no less important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One absolutely exciting thing about life is that ordinary (even boring) moments like this can have such extraordinary impacts. Because of this experience, I have learned to attach due importance to ordinary experiences in everyday life. I have developed a reassurance about keeping on when things don&rsquo;t appear to have any immediate benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have learned to look beyond boredom and to do things that I don&rsquo;t enjoy doing at the moment because I know that it will pay off in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, I have seen the benefits of humility and the price of prejudice. If I had turned down my senior&rsquo;s invitation to the lesson because I thought his motives were questionable or because I didn&rsquo;t want to look dumb, I might have missed an important lesson that would continue to benefit me many years later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Usually, when we judge others we only hurt ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because moments like the one above are quite ordinary, I have come to believe that they are happening on a daily basis. This has made me keener on life and has increased my tolerance for boredom and my endurance for the daily grind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peter Dinklage said &lsquo;The moments that define you have already happened, and they will already happen again.&rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The moments that define you are happening whether you are paying attention or not; they&rsquo;re happening whether you enjoy them or not; they can define you in a helpful or in a way that hurts you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you think that life is boring, consider the impact that your daily drudgery might be having on your life. Consider how significant the actions and decisions you make now can be in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a tragic side to this story that I wanted to leave out but feel that I owe it to that senior to mention in conclusion. I have told the story to the best of my recollection in only a few words as befits a blog post of average length. I haven&rsquo;t told you about my relationship with this senior and what kind of person he was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The keyword here is &ldquo;was&rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, he lost his life few years ago; that is the tragic part. I do not mention this to mourn him again but to celebrate his memory and to do justice to the way that this story portrays the kind of person he was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He wasn&rsquo;t exactly an extraordinary student but he never struggled to pass either. He was a friend of my brother&rsquo;s and we were very close. Outside of school, he had diverse and interesting skills. I found him highly charismatic and showing off was almost one of the trade marks of his charismatic personality. We used to even make light-hearted jokes about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I never got the chance to tell him my side of this story as I did today; I am sure he would have been happy to hear it. I&rsquo;m sure it would have been fulfilling to know that his actions had such a huge positive impact on me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I wonder if my simple actions ever go on the produce an impact on such scale in other people&rsquo;s lives. And so I try to be careful because while some actions (like my senior&rsquo;s) can create positive impact, others can also influence people in a negative way.&lt;/p&gt;', 'defining-moments_1636235000.jpeg', 1, 6, '2021-11-06 20:40:52', '2021-11-06 20:43:20', NULL),

How much thought did you put into it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you usually think things through before taking action? Do you do things with intention or do you just go with the flow every time?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are you mindful of your habits? Do you pay attention to the little things that have almost become second nature? How many times do you unlock your smartphone in a day? How many of those unlocks are actually necessary?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you fall in bed at the end of the day all tired and sleepy, do you take a moment to evaluate the quality of your day? Was it a fulfilling day? Are you tired for the right reasons? Can you account for where every ounce of your energy went?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I believe that being thoughtful is one of the qualities that can greatly enhance the quality of a person&rsquo;s life. It can literally make you healthier, happier, wiser, and even stronger (mentally and emotionally). It is a very cheap investment that yields enormous rewards. And what is more, when you don&rsquo;t invest, you not only miss the rewards, but you also set yourself up for a potential loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we go any further, I want to clarify that when I talk about being thoughtful, I don&rsquo;t mean simply having the capacity to think &mdash; we all can think but not all of us are healthier, happier, wiser, or stronger. I am referring to the much more creative and proactive aspect of thinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, simply buying a beautifully framed birthday message as a birthday gift to someone is&hellip; well, OK. On the other hand, inquiring from close acquaintances of a person for gift ideas for that person, drawing inspiration from your experience knowing that person (their likes, wishes, desires and their dreams for the future), and then proceeding to meticulously package a gift that expresses positive emotions about key aspects of their life and personality, together with a beautiful hand-written note from you to them, I call that thoughtful. Such a gift is more likely to be appreciated and to have a more enduring impression on the person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So why do we not strive to be more thoughtful even when we know how beneficial it is?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are more than enough distractions in this modern age. Most of us have not yet even grasped the gravity of the situation. We are practically slaves and the really sad part is we don&rsquo;t even know it yet. We are so torn in several directions that we don&rsquo;t even pay attention to the things that really matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is such pressure; such constant excitement; a plethora of avenues for stimulation and instant gratification. As a result, setting aside some time to think has almost become a luxury. And yet thinking is one of the most important things we can do for ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we are not being thoughtful, we go about our day without any plan. And you will notice that most often, even on days when we set out without a plan and fancy a full day of leisure and relaxation, we still find ourselves very busy. Things just rush in seemingly out of nowhere as if conscious of the fact that we are free. And before we know it, it is evening and the day is lost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When this happens, our priorities become misplaced. Important questions such as the ones asked at the beginning of this article become neglected and forgotten. We don&rsquo;t eat fruits, we don&rsquo;t drink water, we don&rsquo;t read books, we don&rsquo;t practice healthy hobbies in our pastimes, we don&rsquo;t build skills, we don&rsquo;t monitor and restrict our use of social media&hellip; the list goes on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An idle mind is indeed the devil&rsquo;s workshop. When you abandon your priorities, don&rsquo;t you think that you will be granted the luxury to relax and have fun. Other more harmful things will take the place of your priorities. When you don&rsquo;t consciously impose some order in your life, chaos will set in. And it takes a bit of thought to impose that order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So how do we impose this order in our lives? I can answer this in two words: consistency and rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take some time to identify your priorities. Break down those priorities into actionable steps that you can easily perform. Then practice these steps on a regular schedule. Do it daily or weekly or monthly whatever frequency you choose. Do everything in your power not to skip a session. The goal is to be very consistent to the point where it becomes a habit and you don&rsquo;t even have to consciously think about it before you do it; you would just be doing it as if it were second nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These priorities can be something like this: read every day, workout 2 times a week, publish an article once a week, drink at least 2 liters of water a day, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second word is&nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;rules&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&nbsp;Create strict rules around your priorities and obey those rules as if they were the 10 commandments. The point of these rules is not to restrict you or rob you of your freedom. The rules are only there to guide you. Set healthy rules for yourself and obey those rules. They could be simple rules like never going a day without reading, drinking water, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you start doing the things that matter, all the other distracting harmful, self-indulgent behavior will just naturally fall away without you expending your willpower to address them directly.&lt;/p&gt;', 'are-you-a-thoughtful-person_1636235349.jpeg', 1, 0, '2021-11-06 20:46:12', '2021-11-06 20:49:09', NULL),
(322, 19, 25, 'Reflections of a Young Adult', 'reflections-of-a-young-adult', '&lt;p&gt;I celebrated my birthday this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am somewhere around the middle of my third decade on this earth and I must say that this has been a most peculiar decade. It is a decade as different from the previous two as it is possible for any two things to be different. It feels like only yesterday I was 20 years old. Where did all that time go? Why does time seem to be moving so much faster in this decade than in the previous two?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These days whenever I contemplate the passing of time I shudder. It has not always been so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the old days of childhood and adolescence, it was pure bliss. I lived in the present. I did not strain my mind with thoughts about the future. I did not live outside of the perimeters of a single day (except perhaps when Christmas or some such festivity was approaching.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But those days are gone now and I am almost a man. This is generally the period in almost every young person&rsquo;s life when they experience the most agitation. Or what is generally referred to as the Quarter-life crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is a very delicate period in a person&rsquo;s life, ranging from their early twenties to mid-thirties. A period in which we are at crossroads in almost every aspect of our lives. During this period, our minds are an intricate tangle of delicate emotions, thoughts, and anxieties about the future. They go something like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Am I on a promising career path? What direction is my life taking? What rhythm am I dancing to? What do people think of me? What do&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt;&nbsp;think of me? Do I even know who I am? What I really want out of life? Do I have friends I can boast of? Are my relationships with family and friends healthy? Are they sustainable? Have I made my parents proud? My friends are all moving abroad and making fortunes. The few that remain home are all getting married and settling down. I am doing neither of those two things. Everybody seems to have their shit together &mdash; everybody except me. I feel like I am getting left behind. I am running out of time. I have to make some big, scary decisions and I have to be fast about it; and whatever the consequences, I would have to live with them for the rest of my life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wow, that is one heck of a paragraph, and I&rsquo;m sure it doesn&rsquo;t even cover the whole spectrum. It is very scary, as I&rsquo;m sure almost every young adult will tell you. These doubts and uncertainties are very real. Forget whether they are true or not, their grip on most of our lives is strong, unrelenting, and in some cases paralyzing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How then do we approach these thoughts and anxieties?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before I share my thoughts, I want to make one thing clear: I am only a young adult myself. I do not presume myself an authority on the subject. So take my ideas with a pinch of salt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First of all, I think society is constantly shoving outrageous ideas down our throats. One such idea is how it defines success in life: Lavish home, fancy cars, latest gadgets, a white-collar job, fame, high social status, six-figure bank accounts, and above all, having someone to share all of that with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only does society make this a one size fits all definition for success, it subtly implies that anybody who doesn&rsquo;t have at least one or all of these is a failure. Or that even if they have it and it is not bigger, better, richer than their peers&rsquo;, then they&rsquo;re still not successful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&rsquo;m not against creating wealth or anything like that. On the contrary, I regard it in many ways as a moral responsibility of every individual. What I am more critical of is the motivations and ambitions behind creating it, and most importantly a person&rsquo;s disposition when they don&rsquo;t have as much of it as they&rsquo;d love to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As young adults, it is probably less than a decade ago since we left the shelter of our parents to be exposed to the real world where we have to fend for ourselves. We haven&rsquo;t yet had enough time to understand ourselves enough to form healthy personal principles and values by which to operate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of what we believe about ourselves is only the opinions of others and these do not always correctly represent who we are. That is why the journey to self-discovery is so important. Self-discovery is a big, fancy word so let me put it this way: Start investigating what your strengths are and leveraging on them. Incline more towards experiences and ideas that create joy, meaning, and value to your life and the lives of as many people as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you don&rsquo;t know these things yet, I recommend you apply Tony Robbins&rsquo; advice: take massive action. Try as many things as you possibly can &mdash; anything you can get your hands on. Have a healthy amount of spontaneity in your actions and decisions. Try things you have never done before every once in a while. Engage the world and the world will engage you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first, this might make you feel like a confused moron who doesn&rsquo;t know what he is doing, but believe me, this is not necessarily a bad thing. You are not doomed if by this age you don&rsquo;t yet know what to do with your life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the best things that have happened to me are not the things I planned ahead of time; instead, they are the things I stumbled on while dancing one confused dance or another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is extremely common nowadays to have very smart people who lay their skills to waste in inaction because they are planning, strategizing on the best plan for their lives; or who see failure as something only losers get. Many smart people write themselves off to certain opportunities without ever having given it at least a try. Einstein said that &ldquo;Learning is experience. Everything else is just information.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you try many things, you will eventually find one that you are good at; one that adds value and meaning and joy to your life and the lives of many other people. At this point, you can focus your energy on optimizing that particular thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good thing about vigorously engaging yourself in action is that all those worries we talked about earlier will fall away; or at least, they won&rsquo;t be at the forefront of your mind and therefore won&rsquo;t hinder you working to address them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Worry, anxiety, self-doubt, envy, loneliness, and all the other paralyzing thoughts and emotions will have a harder time weighing you down when you are actively doing some meaningful work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;', 'reflections-of-a-young-adult_1636235509.jpeg', 1, 1, '2021-11-06 20:51:24', '2021-11-06 20:51:49', NULL),
(323, 19, 21, '12 Months Achievement Challenge (or 2019 in review)', '12-months-achievement-challenge-or-2019-in-review', '&lt;p&gt;I began the year 2019 with a genuine desire to grow; to make it my best, most fulfilling year ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://pieceofadvice.org/posts/a-replacement-for-new-year-resolutions-a-12-months-challenge&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; style=&quot;color: inherit;&quot;&gt;openly challenged myself&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;that I would accomplish at least one fit each month that would give me a feeling of deep joy and fulfillment, and then write it down in my journal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus began what I call The 12 Months Achievement Challenge or what is commonly referred to as The Year 20XX in Review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have kept my word. I went through the year ticking off my goals one month at a time, tiny though they are. Here is an account of these goals I recorded as I achieved them:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JANUARY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Writing has been a passion for me since before I knew how to read or write. I know this from the way that, as a grown-up, my mind takes great pleasure in flirting with words and phrases and poetry. I had this same attitude when I was a kid. Back then, instead of words I took pleasure observing the awe-inspiring mountains, the surging rivers, the vast expanse of vegetation on the highway when I traveled, the indefatigable colonies of ants. I reveled in these things. I would engage my mind in them for hours on end. I had what you might call an overactive imagination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have been writing on and off for about 3 years now but there is no bookshop online or offline in the world with a book that bears my name as the author. My writings have always remained to myself, in diaries, journals, note apps, private word documents. This year I decided to create&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://pieceofadvice.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; style=&quot;color: inherit;&quot;&gt;a blog&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;so I can put some of my writing out there. I did this in January and this is a great step for me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FEBRUARY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I designed a&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://complete-php-blog.herokuapp.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; style=&quot;color: inherit;&quot;&gt;full blog website&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;from start to finish using HTML and CSS. I designed this website to use it as course material for my YouTube channel where I create courses that teach my viewers how to code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Towards the end of the month, I was able to record a video tutorial and publish it on Youtube as one in a series of tutorials that will teach my viewers how to build a website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MARCH&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month I created a project for one of my courses on YouTube. This month, I recorded and published 10 video tutorials in which I explain how it&rsquo;s done. This was a monumental task for me as one video would take days to complete. It was also a great tool for self-development because I learned how to communicate better to be understood. Also, I learned that&nbsp;teaching something is one of the best ways of refining and cementing your understanding of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;APRIL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This month was special to me for many reasons. For one thing, it is the month in which I was born. Secondly, it is the month in which I took one among many of the great big steps in my life: April 1st, 2019, I started work at Andela as a Software Engineer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am however not counting the resumption of my new job as my prize accomplishment for this month. That honor goes to my first contract work since joining Andela: Two weeks after resuming at Andela, I was contracted to develop&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.crunchies&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; style=&quot;color: inherit;&quot;&gt;a mobile application&nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;(Android &amp; IOS) for online fast food ordering and delivery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It sounds like a simple application but the work was immense. I gave up on it several times. I was fortunate to have my brother, who has more experience in developing mobile apps who would give me a hand every now and again to unblock me from one challenge or another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MAY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I published an article:&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://pieceofadvice.org/posts/the-bane-and-the-glory-of-introversion&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; style=&quot;color: inherit;&quot;&gt;The Bane and the Glory of Introversion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JUNE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I achieved something in the month of June, but I have managed to forget what it was (I am writing this particular entry in the month of August by which time the stream of time has washed away what memories I might have had of my June achievements.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JULY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I recorded and published a&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGzwvOFUewY&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; style=&quot;color: inherit;&quot;&gt;50-minute long video tutorial&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;on YouTube, completing a tutorial series I&rsquo;d started sometime earlier this year on how to design a blog website. I also deployed the android and IOS versions of the mobile app I had been working on some months past on the Apple Store and the&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.crunchies&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; style=&quot;color: inherit;&quot;&gt;Google Play Store&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AUGUST&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My first Youtube tutorial series was based on how to design a website. It focused on the look of the website. This month I was able to implement all the functionality of the entire website to make it dynamic and database driven. I also recorded and published 11 video tutorials showing my viewers on Youtube on how to make the site dynamic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SEPTEMBER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I lost my job when Andela laid off about 400 employees. I published 10 video tutorials on my YouTube channel. I bought myself a MacBook Pro and a professional microphone for my software engineering work and for recording my courses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OCTOBER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I applied for an Intermediate Software Engineer role at my former company and made it successfully through 3 levels in the application process. The last level will determine whether I get the job or not. It is an interview that hasn&rsquo;t yet taken place at the time of this writing. We don&rsquo;t know what the result will be. We&rsquo;ll probably find out in the next entry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also recorded and published 5 video tutorials on my YouTube channel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOVEMBER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I graduated from&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://lambdaschool.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; style=&quot;color: inherit;&quot;&gt;Lambda School&lt;/a&gt;, an online training academy for software engineers. This marked the end of a 7 months journey that was both fun and bloody hard, especially near the end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also recorded and published 5 tutorials videos on YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And yes, I got an offer for the role I applied for. Yay!!!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DECEMBER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I got the chance to travel. I visited my home country Cameroon from Nigeria. It was a great opportunity for me to reconnect with my friends and strengthen the bonds that hold us together. I did a lot of traveling within Cameroon. I had a lot of deep, meaningful conversations with friends and family. I was inspired. Challenged. Humbled. Grateful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All this got me to contemplate a lot about things in the grand scheme, which is very healthy for a fulfilling life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It took me a certain amount of courage to publish this because I felt I could have done better. However, I firmly believe I wouldn&rsquo;t have achieved this much if I had not openly challenged myself to do it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before 2019, every year I would come up with a comprehensive list of New Year Resolutions and I would think about them throughout January and probably a few times in February and that would be all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year was different. I thought about my goals at least once every month. I tried to do better at least once every month. I was consistent in putting efforts and that is what I value most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So&hellip; this year I got my best job yet, moved to a new country, made many friends and learned a lot in the process. For all of this, I am most grateful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What next?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I look forward to the next year. I consider it a fresh opportunity to apply the lessons I&rsquo;ve picked up over the course of this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I plan on doing something similar next year but I dare to be a bit more specific than the year 2019:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I will forge better bonds with God, family, and friends.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I will eat healthier, drink more water than sweet drinks, and get quality sleep.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I will save at least 3 times more money than I did this year and invest more in my learning and development.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I will create at least one paid course.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I will read every day to better educate myself and to grow into a better person generally.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&rsquo;s it for now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;', '12-months-achievement-challenge-or-2019-in-review_1636235609.jpeg', 1, 0, '2021-11-06 20:52:42', '2021-11-06 20:53:29', NULL),

I am not a certified psychotherapist. As a matter of fact, I wrote this piece for myself because I am one of those who find certain social interactions a bore at best or they get me nervous at worst.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So if you are just seeking some sort of consolation or encouragement from a kindred spirit, then you have come to the perfect place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyways, every time I&rsquo;m feeling anxious in any social situation, sometimes all I need to do is remember to do one of the first 3 tips below, and all will be right with the world again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here they come:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Smile often&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&rsquo;ll tell you a short story. Some time ago I was having a chat with this girl I&rsquo;d been crushing on for many months. It was our first conversation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I just stood there with a straight face, all my strength concentrated on making my voice smooth while concealing the blush on my face and the excitement I was feeling. It did not even occur to me to look her in the face even though she was the one I was talking to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At one point though, my glance fell on her face. She was&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;smiling&lt;/em&gt;. Can you seriously believe that? What I was saying was not at all funny but all the while that I spoke she was looking straight at me and smiling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As soon as I noticed this, deep inside me, I burst into laughter. I had just realized what a nerd I was making of myself. By the time this laughter reached my face, though, I had hushed it to a smile &mdash; a wide and genuine smile. Instantly I felt relaxed and welcome. The blush on my face was now a smile so I didn&rsquo;t need to work too hard to conceal it any longer. All the phantoms of rejection and humiliation that had planted themselves in my imagination slunk away defeated. I had a warm, friendly, and confident conversation with her from then on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smile often, people. It puts you and the person you&rsquo;re talking to at ease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Make eye contact&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Social anxiety is hyper self-consciousness. That is why people will tell you to focus on the crowd when you&rsquo;re giving a public speech instead of on yourself. The more you focus on others, the less anxious you will be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Look the person in the eye. And I don&rsquo;t mean blankly staring at one spot on their face, no. Look at it with an air of curiosity, especially around the eyes. Notice the color of their pupils, how often she blinks; measure the thickness of her eyebrows and how deep or full her eye sockets are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&rsquo;s not all. Most important of all is: listen. Try to make out what the person is saying just by looking at the expression on their face, the words are secondary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They will appreciate it that you are listening to them with interest and that they have your full attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Breath&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes we forget to breathe. When we speak we are expelling air. You can&rsquo;t expect to speak properly when you start speaking immediately after exhaling. Take a pause and breath in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Very often, the reason we forget to breath is that we can&rsquo;t bear a pause in a conversation. In our minds, we&rsquo;ve associated silence with awkwardness, and so even a pause for half a second seems a bad idea. That&rsquo;s not true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get comfortable with pauses in conversation. You can use this time to properly articulate what you are about to say next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You don&rsquo;t have to remember all three of the above to have a smooth and anxiety-free conversation. Sometimes, remembering just one is enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And here&rsquo;s the last tip:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Improve on your vocabulary&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;This one is more of an assignment. The answer to &ldquo;how are you?&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t always have to be &ldquo;fine.&rdquo; There are several ways of saying almost anything and some ways are more interesting than others. Find out different ways of saying the same thing. You can do this by pausing a moment during the conversation to consider a different way of saying it, or you can build it over time by reading more books and writing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You don&rsquo;t have to write a book. You can keep a private journal and write any stories or thoughts you might have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&rsquo;s all, folks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cheers.&lt;/p&gt;', 'how-to-improve-on-social-confidence_1636235809.jpeg', 1, 0, '2021-11-06 20:56:19', '2021-11-06 20:56:49', NULL),
(325, 19, 24, 'Getting laid off, another major change in my life', 'getting-laid-off-another-major-change-in-my-life', '&lt;p&gt;Some 5 months ago, I published an article in which I mused over a major change that had taken place in my life. Some 5 days ago, another major change occurred in my life. The first change was an upturn in my life and career. The more recent one on the other hand is the point where my career seems to have taken something of a nosedive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five months ago I got my best job&nbsp;yet. Five days ago I lost it. I will tell you how I lost my job, why I lost it, and how all of that made me feel; but first, permit me to divert for a minute to say a word or two about words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am a strong believer in the power of words. At the start of this month, I came across a hashtag I thought sounded really cool, probably because of the rhyme. This is it: #SeptemberToRemember. Being the logophile that I am, I immediately personalized the hashtag and left it floating on my mind, promising myself that I would make this September one that I shall ever look back on and smile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;September is not yet over and I know already that it is a month I shall ever look back on; although, whether with a smile or in tears, only time will tell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had been optimistic when I adopted the hashtag. The promise of a September to remember would infuse some enthusiasm and zeal into my actions and decisions. September has drawn close to the end and the prophetic words of the hashtag have come true. It truly is a month to remember.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the way, I don&rsquo;t believe the hashtag has anything to do with me losing my job though. But it seemed too peculiar a coincidence and I thought it worth the mention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enough about words and prophecies and hashtags. Back to the main subject of this article: How I lost my job, why I lost it, and how all of that made me feel?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was working at Andela. Andela is a company that cultivates a talent pool of highly skilled developers in several African countries and gets them to work remotely with global technology companies. Andela has offices in Nigeria, Kenya, Rwanda, Uganda, and Egypt. I worked in Nigeria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the day I was to learn of my layoff, I got up that morning and prepared for work much as I did on any ordinary workday. Three hours later is when I learned that this particular day was not so ordinary after all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The news was broken to us by our CEO, Jeremy Johnson, over a zoom meeting. It took a while for it to sink in. Not long after the meeting on that very day, I received an email informing me that I am one of the 400 employees who had been laid off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So there you have it; that is how I lost my job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why I lost it? A statement made by Jeremy summarizes the reason pretty well: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve hired more junior developers than we are able to place in remote roles,&rdquo; he said. I was hired as a junior developer at Andela, so you see where the wave first took me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be fair to myself, let me also add that I don&rsquo;t consider myself exactly a junior developer. I am something along the lines of intermediate. Anyways, I didn&rsquo;t start this article with the intent to rant about my experience. Moving on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How did all of this make me feel? Well, like most things that take you unawares, my first reaction is one of incredulity, followed by a naive hope that I may yet survive the coming storm somehow; that just maybe, at the very last moment, by some stroke of good fortune, I will be spared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After realizing the futility of my hopes, the next thing I felt was a curiosity for what was to become of my structured life. If I take away the waking up at 6 am; the morning showers; the stopping at the bus stop to board a bus and go to work; the breakfast and lunch with friends and colleagues&hellip; what would remain? What job would I take up next? Would I enjoy it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I felt sad even for people I don&rsquo;t know; for in that pool of 400 developers, I&rsquo;m pretty sure this must have been a very hard blow for a good number of people. We had not seen this coming. We had not braced for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&rsquo;m sure we would all be fine though. We&rsquo;ve gathered a lot of valuable experience in this short time of working at Andela. In fact, when local companies heard of the layoff, they were hunting most of us down with opportunities, because they trust the product of Andela. Andela has that reputation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am confident that for most of us who were laid off, looking back someday in the not so distant future, we will regard this layoff as the best thing to have ever happened to our careers. In fact, that is how I see it already.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am excited about the future, especially now that it is not so predictable. I hope this all works out for the best both for Andela and for the 400 of us.&lt;/p&gt;', 'getting-laid-off-another-major-change-in-my-life_1636235930.jpeg', 1, 1, '2021-11-06 20:58:32', '2021-11-06 20:58:50', NULL);

(326, 19, 21, 'The Bane and the Glory of Introversion', 'the-bane-and-the-glory-of-introversion', '&lt;p&gt;It often astonishes me to see just how different one person can be from another. As an introvert in a world dominated by extroverts, the sight of an extrovert just being himself (or herself) is often a wonder to me. Where they get the energy to go about excitedly partying, participating in long animated conversations and social activities in general, will always remain a mystery to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I like connecting and socializing&nbsp;with other people. But unlike most extroverts, I have a low tolerance threshold for such experiences. When I&rsquo;ve reached this threshold, I feel a strong urge to just separate myself from all the noise. I just want to be alone and quiet. Any further activity in the social group is liable to bore me to tears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In many ways, this aspect of my personality has been the cause of much distress in my social life and misunderstanding among my friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my days in the University, after a stressful day at school, I would retire to my comfy room and occupy myself with what introverts do when they&rsquo;re alone: reading, writing, listening to music, audiobooks or just enjoying my exclusive company and the sound of the quiet. Then suddenly to my horror, I hear a knock at the door.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;&lt;em&gt;Oh no, I was having such a beautiful time, don&rsquo;t let anybody interrupt it,&lt;/em&gt;&rdquo; I murmur to myself as I walk to the door.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I open the door and there stands one extrovert friend or another. He looks around and finds that I&rsquo;m alone. Next thing I see is a benign smile on his face; the sort of smile that seems to say,&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Ta-da! Now you don&rsquo;t have to be all by yourself. I&rsquo;ll be here for a while to keep you company and save you from this &ldquo;loneliness.&rdquo;&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;And by doing this he would think he is doing me a heroic service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While me, on the other hand, would feel a strong desire to just slam the door in his face and go back to doing my thing. But we live in a world of human beings where we are expected to be courteous; so I drop my fantasies of rudeness and return his smile (an artificial one, mind you) and ask him to come in and make himself at home. What else can I say?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, to be truthful, I could just be candid and tell him that this is not a convenient time and ask him to call me next time before coming to my house. I have never said this to any of my friends though; I have a vague conviction that the day I ever say this to a friend will be the last day that friend ever shows his face at my house again, and that is not the outcome I want.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is some quirkiness to things I love and the way I love them that I believe has everything to do with my introversion. I love things deeply, and the kind of things I love might bore you to tears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I find so much joy in simple things. And because our world is overflowing with simple things, the world becomes practically limitless to me. A good song to me then is a whole universe. I listen to it hundreds and hundreds of times and grow only more interested in the song. I deconstruct the rhythms, the melody, the rhyme and the poetry in the lyrics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such things stir up memories: Favorite songs from long ago, an old picture, the right smell, a book I enjoyed reading sometime in the past, and sometimes, even just a word will place me on the wings of memory, and then I would ride down memory lane to those good old days, the memories of which electrify me for their beauty and nostalgia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it is the trickling sounds of streams, the chirping of birds, the hissing of the trees as they sway softly in a gentle breeze; all this is music to my ears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At times when I step out on the streets after a prolonged moment of quiet and solitude, it is the roaring of locomotive engines and the general noise from an agitated city that fills me with a thrilling sensation and makes me feel very much alive. I guess this is the sensation that people seek in drugs like cocaine and the like. And yet, sometimes the very next moment, these very sounds are a nuisance to my ears and I just want to take refuge in the quiet of my room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are also such hobbies as reading, writing, software development, art. Each gives me a deep feeling of joy and each demands that I court her and her alone with all the time that I have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is all beautiful but at the back of my mind, a faint voice questions the normalcy of this way of life: Is this how a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; human being is supposed to be?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I recognize that voice. It is the quiet but stern voice that makes itself heard when something feels &ldquo;too good to be true.&rdquo; And this solitude, my dear reader, feels dangerously beautiful, and so I try to listen to that voice and try to answer its question:&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;I don&rsquo;t think this is normal. I don&rsquo;t want to grow into some kind of beast who can only live alone and isolated. I am supposed to spend more time with others and socialize.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You see, as much as I glory in solitude, sometimes when I&rsquo;ve had enough of it, I just can&rsquo;t bear any more of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Past this point, I begin to ask myself why I&rsquo;m so different. This curiosity soon gives way to an undertone of angry dissatisfaction with myself for not being like other people who are all buoyant and lively all the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has taken me years to come to the understanding that this is only a problem if I worry and beat myself over it. For I have known many of those extroverts whom I admire and want to be like them, who also look at me and long to be the person they believe me to be: calm and collected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sometimes the storm that is within us is only visible to us, and this storm seems to have only as much power over us as we have made it the center of our worries.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As introverts, it appears to be our lot in life to get misunderstood quite a lot. For extroverts, their idea of a good time is hanging out with at least half a dozen friends in animated discussions for hours on end. For me and most introverts, things are not that straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I enjoy such a company very much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I don&rsquo;t. When I&rsquo;m not enjoying it, I feel my energy drain the longer I stay in such gathering, especially when I have to do some of the talking, which doesn&rsquo;t come easily to me. I feel like my &ldquo;lifeforce&rdquo; is being sucked away. It feels like I am receiving a &ldquo;Dementor&rsquo;s kiss.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, I just like to be with someone I can trust enough to say anything and to have long deep conversations in a quiet, serene atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, I prefer a company of three so that I can conveniently shut my mouth while the other two do all the talking. On some such occasions, it soon gets too quiet and I know the silence is having an awkward and unsettling effect on the others. But instead of going through the drudgery of thinking up something to say to fill the silence with, I just shut my mouth and be myself. At such times, veiled behind that silence is an undercurrent of a petty vengeance that I exact on a world that is so unwelcoming to my kind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In almost every social setting, more often than not, every word I utter or every minute spent listening to others is hard work. And sadly enough, most people glorify these qualities above everything else. So at times, I want the world to endure my own world, one of silence which the world has an unfounded problem with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The funny thing is, you might expect me to know when I prefer to be alone or in a company of two or three or half a dozen, but this is just as oblivious to me as it might be to you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider the case of the friend who visits me at my inconvenient hour of solitude. After enduring his company for a quarter of an hour or so, I begin to enjoy it very much; even more than I enjoyed my solitude before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it is only after they have left that I realize that I really needed company and that my solitude had not been quite as beautiful as I initially thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is my account of introversion by the way. I know there are many kinds of introverts. Some will easily relate to what is said in this article. Others will not. And if I take a bird&rsquo;s-eye view of introversion and the role it has played in the making of me, I wouldn&rsquo;t say I am flawed. I wouldn&rsquo;t say I have a superpower either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&rsquo;t believe my life would have been any better or worse than it is now if I&rsquo;d been an extrovert instead of an introvert. If I ever deserved blame for any particular failure in my life, then it&rsquo;s because I screwed up and not because I am an introvert. On the other hand, if I ever deserved praise for any worthy achievement, it is because I paid the price (or maybe just good fortune) and not because my introversion gave me superpowers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&rsquo;m not glorifying introversion over extroversion. Both have their strengths and their shortcomings and it would serve you well to know who you are and how to leverage your temperament to your advantage.&lt;/p&gt;', 'the-bane-and-the-glory-of-introversion_1636236102.jpeg', 1, 122, '2021-11-06 21:00:15', '2022-01-02 08:26:52', NULL),
(327, 19, 21, 'A replacement for new year resolutions — A 12 months challenge', 'a-replacement-for-new-year-resolutions-a-12-months-challenge', '&lt;p&gt;Many times I have come across instances where some people scorn the practice of setting New Year Resolutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their reason for this goes something like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The very word resolution is an indication of some form of internal conflict springing from an ineffectual self-governance in a person. It means the individual is waging a fight against something undesirable in their life; or is making a conscious decision to pursue certain ideals that before were absent in their life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aren&rsquo;t you supposed to&nbsp;be pursuing these ideals every day of your life? Isn&rsquo;t it supposed to be the default state of your life? Why would you wait for a new year before you make a resolution to better your life?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such people also avoid new year resolutions or scorn the practice thereof because, for them, experience has proven it to be ineffective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&rsquo;t entirely agree with such people. I am not advocating the practice of new year resolutions either. But I&rsquo;d sooner advise a person to set new year resolutions they will end up abandoning by the end of January than advise them to sleepwalk through their life the entire year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the very least, setting new year resolutions means that you still have an interest in making your life better, and that is a good place to start. You just need a better strategy than new year resolutions, which is what I bring to the table today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I call it The&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;12 months challenge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This challenge is simple: At the end of the year, write and publish an article in which you list 12 of your proudest, most fulfilling accomplishments from each of the 12 months of that year. Be very strict with the rules of the challenge: Pick only one accomplishment per month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You are free to accomplish as many things in a month as you can but pick only one to be added to the list for any particular month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Publish this article on your blog (if you have one), on your LinkedIn profile, and on any of the social media platforms; share it with your close network of trusted family members, friends, colleagues, and mentors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is very important that you share the article to as wide an audience as possible if the contents are not too private. Sharing such an article can help you connect with other individuals with shared interests, dreams, and plans for the future. And such connections can open doors for you and a lot of other people that you never knew existed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, if you know you are preparing the article to share it with other people, you are more likely to take it very seriously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One thing I almost avoided mentioning is the nature of these accomplishments. I&rsquo;m avoiding this aspect of the challenge because I can&rsquo;t really tell you what you should aim at accomplishing in your life in order to feel fulfilled. You are going to have to do that yourself because only you can do it best. It is your purpose. You may think you don&rsquo;t know it yet but at some deeper level, you do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can only tell you what works for me: I have a few questions I usually ask myself when I feel that I am not living a fulfilling life at any time in my life. At such times I ask myself:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I were to be diagnosed with terminal cancer and given only 6 months to live, how would I spend that time? What things would I value most? What would I regret not doing?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For me, the answers to such questions immediately and unmistakably stand out clear in my mind:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would regret not taking better care of my parents than what I am doing. They have toiled and soiled far too much for me to be ordinary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would grieve in my spirit at all those years I felt timid and settled for far far less than I am worth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would regret my passivity in relationships with all those amazing people who have once featured in my life and left because of my apparent disinterest. I could have swallowed my pride and risked exposing my insecurities, my quirks and my shortcomings in general. Hiding them only made me look uninterested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would regret all those hours I wasted feeling bored when I could have set up a blog to explore my passion for writing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I could have read more and more books.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would regret never having taken any steps towards realizing all those side projects I kept conceiving day after day in my mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And many more&hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you ask yourself the above questions, the answers will pop up almost immediately and they will fill you with a new vitality and enthusiasm towards your life goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now assume your time from now on is as limited and valuable as it could be if the above assumption about cancer were real. Then start working on these projects one month at a time. Start living your unlived life one month at a time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you publish this article at the end of the year, can you please share it with me. I would love to see you take that life by the throat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;', 'a-replacement-for-new-year-resolutions-a-12-months-challenge_1636236225.jpeg', 1, 4, '2021-11-06 21:02:35', '2021-11-06 21:03:45', NULL),
(328, 19, 29, 'Adapting to challenges as a first time Bootcamper', 'adapting-to-challenges-as-a-first-time-bootcamper', '&lt;p&gt;I am currently in the second week of my first ever developer Bootcamp and so far it has been exciting. Although this is the second week of the actual on-site Bootcamp, I&rsquo;d begun working on my project for the Bootcamp over a month ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If my project for the Bootcamp had been like one of those fun projects I&rsquo;ve been used to imagining and developing just for the fun of it, I&rsquo;m sure would have long since completed the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this is Bootcamp&nbsp;and there are specific guidelines (in my case challenges) that must be followed, as well as a limited set of tools/technologies which must be used in developing the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my case, I was supposed to build a full-stack JavaScript application in which I was required to use only CSS for the design of the user interface &mdash; no CSS frameworks. The backend was to be done in Node.js/Express and I was required to use no packages besides&nbsp;&lt;code style=&quot;background-color: rgb(242, 242, 242);&quot;&gt;pg&lt;/code&gt;,&nbsp;&lt;code style=&quot;background-color: rgb(242, 242, 242);&quot;&gt;bcrypt&lt;/code&gt;,&nbsp;&lt;code style=&quot;background-color: rgb(242, 242, 242);&quot;&gt;jsonwebtoken&lt;/code&gt;,&nbsp;&lt;code style=&quot;background-color: rgb(242, 242, 242);&quot;&gt;express&lt;/code&gt;,&hellip;basically, packages whose functionality I cannot possibly implement on my own in a reasonable time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The requirements for this application were summarized in the form of challenges and they were number 1 to 4. The application itself would have been an easy thing for me to build, but when I started seeing strange requirements and the fixed set of tools/technologies I must use, I knew that I was in for an adventure. Clearly, it required that I change my old ways of building web applications and learn and adapt to new ways in order to solve the challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Challenge One&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Challenge One was to build the UI templates. The challenging thing about this challenge was that I had to learn raw CSS without depending on predefined styles that frameworks have been providing for me in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the first day of this challenge, I scoured YouTube for video tutorials on how to design a website using raw CSS. After following a few tutorials, I gathered enough understanding of CSS to be able to position items well on the webpage. I built the UI interfaces alright, but they were not mobile-friendly because I&rsquo;d been using fixed-size units like pixels. Plus, I&rsquo;d written no media queries for small-sized screens because I hadn&rsquo;t yet been used to working with them in the past&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I read a few articles and was able to write them and define how my page should look on screens of various sizes using media queries. When I&rsquo;d finished writing my media queries, I realized there were just too many CSS rules for a number of screen sizes and it was hard to write and modify.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I set out again to look for a solution to this. Searching on Google, I came upon the CSS grid layout system. I was able to write just a few lines of code using Grid and they would make my items on the page responsive without needing to write extra CSS rules in media queries for these items in smaller-sized screens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Challenge Two&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pretty much everything in the second challenge was new to me. Not only was I required to build API endpoints with Node.js/Express, I had to write tests for these endpoints too &mdash; which I have no experience of. I was also required to use Git as my version control and to follow strict rules in making pull requests and branches which were also new to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had to meet a more experienced developer to explain these Git concepts to me because the tutorials online did not provide a clear enough explanation of these concepts to me. After his explanation, I understood that I each feature I was about to implement, I had to create a branch off of develop branch and implement the feature on the feature branch. After finishing with the feature, I could push the feature branch upstream and raise a pull request on the develop branch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was now able to work on different features, chores, and bugs on the API using branches and pull requests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By this point, I&rsquo;d still been working remotely. When I came on-site, however, I was assigned a learning facilitator assistant who went through my work giving me feedback. He pointed out all my faults and mistakes in my use of the tools and the project as a whole and I had to go over my work incorporating the feedback I received from him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Challenge Three&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am currently working on Challenge Three. Right now I&rsquo;ve already adapted to most of the tools I will be needing to work on Challenge three. My work has been going smoothly so far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this challenge, I&rsquo;m required to implement user authentication and authorization using JSON web tokens. JSON web tokens are the only new concept I had to learn in this challenge and was able to quickly pick it up by following a video tutorial on YouTube since it&rsquo;s not too difficult to understand even for a first-timer like me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, these challenges have gotten me out of my comfort zone, given me an in-depth understanding of how some of the libraries and frameworks I have been using are implemented and taught me a host of new concepts about Git, project management, collaboration, and more.&lt;/p&gt;', 'adapting-to-challenges-as-a-first-time-bootcamper_1636236750.jpeg', 1, 1, '2021-11-06 21:06:10', '2021-11-06 21:14:27', NULL),
(329, 19, 29, 'What a coding Bootcamp feels like for a first timer', 'what-a-coding-bootcamp-feels-like-for-a-first-timer', '&lt;p&gt;Until about 6 weeks ago, I&rsquo;d never before participated in any developer Bootcamp. I had only a vague idea of what a Bootcamp actually was. At first, when I thought of a Bootcamp, I envisioned veteran developers doing presentations, live coding sessions, peer programming, mentorships; guiding learners step-by-step on how to build real-life projects and doing this for like 15 hours a day stretching across two weeks or so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe I was right. Maybe not. I was going to find out soon enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The day came when&nbsp;I was going to participate in a Bootcamp myself. I&rsquo;d applied as a developer at&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://andela.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; style=&quot;color: inherit;&quot;&gt;Andela&lt;/a&gt;, &mdash; a company that trains some of Africa&rsquo;s most talented developers and supplies companies across the globe with high-performing engineering teams to solve the talent shortage problem, and I managed through a competitive selection process to make it to the Bootcamp level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One month before the Bootcamp, I was emailed a document requiring me to start working on a full-stack application project called Fast-Food-Fast, an online food delivery service. I was super excited. I began designing the UI templates in HTML and raw CSS (no frameworks). About a week into the project, I&rsquo;d finished building the UI pages and proceeded to build the API endpoints for the application.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That first week I was buried in intense work because I wasn&rsquo;t used to designing with raw CSS. But I managed to pull off a really good-looking&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://awamelvine.github.io/fast-food-fast/ui/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; style=&quot;color: inherit;&quot;&gt;UI&lt;/a&gt;. What is more, my CSS skills went off the roof.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was one of two challenges that were emailed to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The the second challenged required me to build a node API and implement endpoints for some of the features of the application. This would have been a very easy task for me (considering that I had been working with node.js for some time already), if I had not been told to write tests for the endpoints, integrate continuous integration with travisCI, code climate and test coverage reporting with coveralls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The actual building of the API was a breeze. It was fun and I enjoyed building it. However, apart from node/express.js, pretty much every tool/technology that the project required was new to me and there were many of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So after the first challenge, I used the first 2 days, scouring the popular web platforms for tutorials on code testing, test coverage reporting, code climate, testing with mocha and chai, GitHub workflow and best practices for commits and pull requests, as well as deploying on Heroku. They were all very intimidating at first but on the second day, I felt I&rsquo;d gathered enough knowledge about how these tools work to begin coding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The actual coding of the API endpoints was not the challenge. In fact, it took me only an hour or so to get my API endpoints working. The herculean task was the tests and the various integrations. I pretty much stumbled my way through most of these tools, blindly following tutorial after tutorial until around day 4 when I finally finished the requirements of the second challenge. At this point, I stopped advancing and began retracing my steps and trying to wrap my head around code that I had written myself; making improvements on things that needed improvement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&rsquo;d already learned so much just sitting alone at my computer. I could only imagine how much more progress I was going to make when the on-sight Bootcamp actually started. I couldn&rsquo;t wait to meet my co-bootcampers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two weeks later, I attended the first day of the on-site Bootcamp at Andela. We were over 60 of us as Bootcampers and pretty much every one of these faces were new to me. I was thrilled to meet them and by the end of that day I&rsquo;d connected with and exchanged contacts with a couple of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout the whole day, much to my surprise, we didn&rsquo;t write any code. After some presentations and self introduction, we were placed in groups of 5 or so bootcampers, and each group was assigned a Learning Facilitator Assitant (LFA). Each person had their project reviewed by their LFA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was very surprised after my LFA reviewed my project and gave me feedback. When coming to the Bootcamp, I was confident that I&rsquo;d done the perfect job. But it is only when I sat with my LFA and he began to review my project that I kept seeing fault after fault.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wrote his review on a sheet of paper and according to the Bootcamp, I was going to implement it myself &mdash; unlike I had initially thought. No big deal, I went to work incorporating the feedback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although there has not been the kind of live coding sessions with experts showing me step-by-step as I&rsquo;d imagined, there was collaboration. Every time I hit on a blocker or a challenge I couldn&rsquo;t quickly solve, I always reached out to my peers or my LFA and almost always got immediate responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This has accelerated my learning faster than when I&rsquo;d been coding solely alone. Right now I have come close to completing a full-stack JavaScript application with little assistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Andela, I was introduced to this idea behind learning expressed in the acronym YOYO &mdash; You Own Your Own learning. This went against what I thought about learning at Bootcamps and I didn&rsquo;t think it a nice idea at all at first. However, when I look over the past 3 days of learning on my own, I don&rsquo;t think I would have learned the vital skills I have now if I&rsquo;d been relying on anybody to hold my hand and lead me every step of the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The YOYO approach to learning doesn&rsquo;t mean you just be an island as you learn. It means teaching yourself problem-solving skills and also how to code and to reach out and collaborate when you hit on a blocker or need another person&rsquo;s expertise to surmount a particular obstacle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a popular saying that work always expands to fill the time available for it. In the past 3 days, I have learned so much and achieved more than I could have achieved in a longer time period and that is what makes Bootcamps great.

I didn&rsquo;t think it was worth my time to go about learning another CSS framework or a whole school of thought around design.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: rgb(250, 250, 250); color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8);&quot;&gt;And then I was shortlisted for the&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://andela.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; style=&quot;background-color: rgb(250, 250, 250); color: inherit;&quot;&gt;Andela&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: rgb(250, 250, 250); color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8);&quot;&gt;&nbsp;Bootcamp and given a task to complete before the Bootcamp. I was required to design a complete, mobile-responsive static website from scratch and I was not allowed to use any CSS frameworks &mdash; only raw CSS.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8);&quot;&gt;This one requirement just about burst my bubble. I had built complete, mobile-responsive web applications in the past, but this time it was all different since I had been used to CSS frameworks like bootstrap in the past. I had very little knowledge of CSS and I realized this when I was having a really hard time arranging a list of items on the webpage in a grid format.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8);&quot;&gt;I had a few items on the page and I wanted to lay them out in a grid format.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;ql-syntax&quot; spellcheck=&quot;false&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wrapper&quot;&gt;\r\n   &lt;div class=&quot;item&quot;&gt;item 1&lt;/div&gt;\r\n   &lt;div class=&quot;item&quot;&gt;item 2&lt;/div&gt;\r\n   &lt;div class=&quot;item&quot;&gt;item 3&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: rgb(250, 250, 250); color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8);&quot;&gt;I tried to use regular CSS properties like&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code style=&quot;background-color: rgb(242, 242, 242); color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8);&quot;&gt;max-width&lt;/code&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: rgb(250, 250, 250); color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8);&quot;&gt;,&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code style=&quot;background-color: rgb(242, 242, 242); color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8);&quot;&gt;min-width&lt;/code&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: rgb(250, 250, 250); color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8);&quot;&gt;,&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code style=&quot;background-color: rgb(242, 242, 242); color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8);&quot;&gt;display: inline-block;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: rgb(250, 250, 250); color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8);&quot;&gt;, together with CSS media queries. I wouldn&rsquo;t say I was satisfied with the results even though it took me a lot of time and effort to write. My CSS code was pretty huge and difficult to update. Each update on the UI required that I pay close attention to how it will be reflected on screens with various sizes as defined in my media queries. This meant that each major update on the styling required that I test the various screen sizes and make the appropriate adjustments such as when to break to a new line.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: rgb(250, 250, 250);&quot;&gt;Seeing that this was just too delicate and far too complicated and time-consuming to code, I began looking for other alternatives. A google search let me to an article about the grid layout system in CSS!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: rgb(250, 250, 250); color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8);&quot;&gt;CSS Grid Layout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: rgb(250, 250, 250); color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8);&quot;&gt;CSS grids is a cool, two-dimensional grid layout system in CSS supported by all the major browsers. It allows you to display items in a grid layout (columns and rows) and takes care of the positioning, size, and the responsiveness of the items for you with only two lines of CSS code.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: rgb(250, 250, 250); color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8);&quot;&gt;I was surprised at first to find out the CSS grid layout is actually an in-built CSS feature, not some framework as I initially thought. So how does it work?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: rgb(250, 250, 250); color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8);&quot;&gt;Say we want the above items to be displayed horizontally with each having a margin of 5px and occupying the same with on the page, these three lines are enough to achieve that for us:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;ql-syntax&quot; spellcheck=&quot;false&quot;&gt;.wrapper {\r\n   display: grid;\r\n   grid-gap: 5px;\r\n   grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;\r\n}\r\n&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: rgb(250, 250, 250); color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8);&quot;&gt;Now, these lines will display the items horizontally, each occupying the same fraction (fr) of the available width with 5px of margin around each.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: rgb(250, 250, 250); color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8);&quot;&gt;This is not exactly responsive though. When you shrink your browser (or you use smaller screens), these items will just squeeze. To make the items stack up on top of each other when each item has been squeezed down to a width of 300px, we will just need to modify the&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code style=&quot;background-color: rgb(242, 242, 242); color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8);&quot;&gt;grid-template-colums&lt;/code&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: rgb(250, 250, 250); color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8);&quot;&gt;&nbsp;property like so:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;ql-syntax&quot; spellcheck=&quot;false&quot;&gt;grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr));\r\n&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: rgb(250, 250, 250); color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8);&quot;&gt;The auto-fit argument is what will cause an item to wrap when it&rsquo;s width shrinks down to the 300px threshold. This line is essentially the same as the former line with only the addition of wrapping and also the width. The repeat() function just spreads this style over all three items.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: rgb(250, 250, 250); color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8);&quot;&gt;Now if I were to attempt to achieve this with other basic CSS properties, I would have had to write a lot more lines of CSS code than this.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: rgb(250, 250, 250); color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8);&quot;&gt;There are also several other very powerful properties of the CSS grid layout some of which include:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code style=&quot;background-color: rgb(242, 242, 242); color: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-template-rows&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;grid-template-rows&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code style=&quot;background-color: rgb(242, 242, 242); color: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-template-areas&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;grid-template-areas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code style=&quot;background-color: rgb(242, 242, 242); color: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-template&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;grid-template&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code style=&quot;background-color: rgb(242, 242, 242); color: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-auto-columns&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;grid-auto-columns&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code style=&quot;background-color: rgb(242, 242, 242); color: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-auto-rows&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;grid-auto-rows&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code style=&quot;background-color: rgb(242, 242, 242); color: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-auto-flow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;grid-auto-flow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: rgb(250, 250, 250); color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8);&quot;&gt;You can view a full list of them&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout#Reference&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; style=&quot;background-color: rgb(250, 250, 250); color: inherit;&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: rgb(250, 250, 250); color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8);&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8);&quot;&gt;With these properties, you can choose to align the items vertically instead using the&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code style=&quot;color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8); background-color: rgb(242, 242, 242);&quot;&gt;grid-template-rows&lt;/code&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8); background-color: rgb(250, 250, 250);&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: rgb(250, 250, 250); color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8);&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: rgb(250, 250, 250); color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8);&quot;&gt;With such dramatic reduction in the amount of code one writes when using CSS grid as opposed to media queries and regular CSS properties, it goes without saying therefore that CSS grid is a far better option if you want to display items in a grid layout without the need for CSS frameworks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;', 'the-power-css-grid-layout-in-designing-responsive-layouts_1636237007.jpeg', 1, 2, '2021-11-06 21:15:21', '2022-05-27 21:11:07', NULL),

Do you give up after your first try?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your answer to the above questions is yes, then you are what Dr. Carol Dweck refers to as a Fixed Mindset person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A fixed mindset person is someone who believes that a person&rsquo;s talents and abilities are innate and there&rsquo;s nothing they can do to change or improve on them. They believe that, as a person, you are either born smart or you are not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clearly, if you want to grow your skills and abilities to achieve more, you definitely will be needing a different mindset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How can you adopt the right mindset to grow in your skill level, abilities, and performance? And what&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;&nbsp;the right mindset? You probably guessed it already: the&nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Growth Mindset,&nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;a term coined by Dr. Carol Dweck after her research on learning methods. In this article, I share with you what this mindset means and how I used it to double my learning abilities and skills as a software developer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Growth Mindset&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;A person with a Growth mindset carries the belief that skills and abilities can be improved upon by constant practice, research, and use of better strategies or approaches to challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a software developer, long before I was introduced to this concept of the growth mindset, I had been employing it unconsciously as I developed software. I spent more time debugging software than I did actually building the software. I don&rsquo;t remember giving up just because I hit on a bug in my code that I couldn&rsquo;t immediately and effortlessly solve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would reach out for help from more experienced developers in person as well as online on question and answer platforms like StackOverflow where I sought out help from other more experienced developers. I came to points where I needed to study concepts that were new to me in order to fix the bugs in my code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least, I could say that at that time, I had a growth mindset more or less. But is this all you need to double your skills? Of course, there&rsquo;s more to it than just hitting on problems and reaching out for solutions. Most everybody does that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I came to understand what a growth mindset actually meant, I realized that at some level, I actually had some traces of a fixed mindset still lurking in my methods of approaching problems. Though there were not as pronounced as the growth mindset, they still affected my learning and productivity in a negative way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I learned then that it is possible to have both mindsets and that the effects that ended up prevailing in my results depended on which activities or behaviors from the two mindsets I engaged more in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I told myself that If I needed to grow as a developer, I indulge more in behaviors of a Growth mindset personality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I began consciously reaching out more when I hit on challenges; I began taking on tasks that were a bit more challenging than the ones I&rsquo;ve achieved in the past. I doubled my time of coding and started adopting better strategies from more experienced developers in developing my own software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 5 months after I read about the Growth Mindset, I confidently joined the team of developers at the company I was working for at the time to work on a Train Ticketing System, the most complex challenge I&rsquo;d ever taken up until that time. The technical requirements of the software were clearly beyond my skill level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first challenge was the fact that I needed to learn a new programming tool, Angular Js while simultaneously applying it to the project I was building.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After I&rsquo;d understood Angular Js by watching and learning from many video courses on YouTube and had begun working on the project, there was now the problem of the data structures and algorithms to use and how to represent information such as the train wagons, how to uniquely identify which seats belonged to which wagon, which seats were bad on the train that required us to reflect this on the interface, and whether a particular wagon is made of beds (VIP) or just normal seats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All these intricacies launched me into a sea of bugs and problems with my algorithms. This kept me constantly reaching out for better algorithms and more efficient data structures incorporating them into my project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I started designing the database, for example, I was using a&nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;seats&lt;/strong&gt;&nbsp;table to hold records of each train seat. I then created a relationship between this&nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;seats&lt;/strong&gt;&nbsp;table and the&nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;wagons&lt;/strong&gt;&nbsp;table to track which seats belonged to which wagon. And Oh, I also had to keep track of which wagon belonged to which&nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;train&lt;/strong&gt;&nbsp;and which seats have been booked and which are still empty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At one point the performance of the application was very low because of the many requests to the database. After days of pondering and searching for efficient methods, I finally reached out to a senior developer in my company who advised me to create a data structure for the seats (an array) as opposed to the&nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;seats&lt;/strong&gt;&nbsp;table, serialize this data structure and store it as text in a seats attribute of each wagon so that when I need to use the seats of a wagon, I can just query that wagon and unserialize the seats field so as to perform operations on the seats themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few months down the line, my team and I had successfully built a complete module that was not only functional but highly flexible and feature-rich. Our system could now process information about a train of about a thousand seats without much effect on the speed of the application.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results inspired me. I began to value my efforts over my competency experience and approached my work with enthusiasm and a conviction that I can do the impossible. I would reach more often than I used to and in so doing, I was able to suck up more knowledge from other experienced developers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would say that I had been a growth mindset person before I knew what it meant to have a growth mindset. But my skills only doubled when I began consciously applying the principles of a growth mindset such as stretching my tendencies to reach out for assistance, seeking better ways to learn and achieve things, reminding myself that with more effort and the right strategies and mentors, I can achieve almost anything.&lt;/p&gt;', 'growth-mindset-and-how-i-doubled-my-skills-as-a-developer_1636237140.jpeg', 1, 40, '2021-11-06 21:17:28', '2022-02-24 08:11:50', NULL);

I enjoyed computer programming in the days I was being introduced to it than now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I find this tendency repeated in almost any activity that requires the engagement of my mind. Why is that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take reading, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past, I approached reading with an open and virtually empty mind. Whatever material I happened to be reading was relatively new to me, so I read with utmost curiosity. I paid great attention as I read, hanging on to every word.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result reading was more of an entertainment. I could get lost in it for hours at a time without getting interrupted by even a single thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I didn&rsquo;t give reading my full attention because I found it entertaining; it was entertaining because I gave it my full attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also there were no rules: I didn&rsquo;t have to read at this particular speed or that. I didn&rsquo;t have to finish reading a particular number of books within any particular time lapse. There were no books I should read and books I shouldn&rsquo;t read. Every book was a good book to read. Every time I chose was a good time to read. Being only a student, time was relatively cheap for me, and so I read like I had all the time in the world to read. That is why I could hang on to every word without being interrupted by any stray thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is what makes reading interesting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today it is different. I have read my fair share of books since the day I started reading. Some of the books I&rsquo;ve read have helped me but most of them remain as idle knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, when I pick up a book to read, I no longer have the same excitement towards reading as I used to in the past. I can hardly concentrate for a full hour on reading without getting carried away by my own thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My experience of reading has filled my mind with prejudices and rules that are more often than not unnecessary or even harmful. Now I find some books uninteresting. I know that&rsquo;s okay, it shows that I have learned enough by now to know that not all books are well written or are the right material for me to read.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what about the books I know are important for me, the ones I know I really need to read? Even with such books I&rsquo;m hardly as excited reading them as I used to be in the past. Even when I manage to start reading it, somewhere at the back of my mind there is always this nagging thought that maybe the other book I saw was a better read than this one. As such I can hardly maintain the same focus reading it as I could do in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, it often takes some conscious stubbornness on my part to stick to a book and read it to the end or long enough to get myself interested in it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I need to pick up the old reading habit again. I will find almost any book more interesting if I give it my full attention. The brain delights in diving deep into one thought rather than many surface-level thoughts at once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same goes for programming or any studying. It is the true path to mastery. It is how you get the most out of your reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reading many books alone is not all that matters. How much you can get out of a book is what matters. A good book, if read with enough attention and contemplation, is worth about 5 other books. (This is no scientific finding, it&rsquo;s my opinion born from my experience of reading.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once I have decided what book I need to read, I should put away all rules and just read the book with the trust of a child.&lt;/p&gt;', 'going-back-to-the-healthy-reading-habits-of-old_1636237199.jpeg', 1, 0, '2021-11-06 21:19:48', '2022-06-04 13:47:48', NULL),

I have had a fairly productive day in my estimation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My stomach hurts. It&rsquo;s not aching or anything like that, it just hurts because I have stuffed it to full capacity with food and drink. I haven&rsquo;t been a glutton, mind you. I have had two meals today which seems about the number of meals a normal human being is supposed to have in a day, if a meal less. But I have drunk a bit too much. Not wine or beer, just water (and a beverage or two). And yet, I still feel thirsty.

I could name a few more but I think I have named enough to make my point; the point being that I have noticed something common in these TV Shows...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nevermind the time but I am writing this on the following day. That makes it 3 days since I began writing this article. Hopefully I get to publish it today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&rsquo;ll continue from where I stopped yesterday evening. I was making a point about how all of the sitcoms I enjoyed watching are full of diverse characters with many quirks and flaws whose lives are intertwined by some bond of friendship, family, or work, and, even though they are very different in many ways, they still manage to co-exist in such harmony as you would never have imagined possible given that they are so&hellip;imperfect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have learned that&nbsp;very often, the things we perceive as flaws in other people are often just pet peeves of ours, and that if we are just a bit more patient and open-minded, we can come around to seeing them very differently. I used to think that being disorderly is the mark of immaturity; I don&rsquo;t think like that anymore. Sure, immature people can be very disorderly but the reverse isn&rsquo;t always the case and I would much rather err on the side of not being judgemental.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have known people who, in my initial opinion, oozed arrogance and pride simply because of the &ldquo;artificial&rdquo; spring in their step or the manner in which they flaunted their good looks or money to garner attention; after getting to know them personally though, I would realize just how unfair and judgemental it was of me to think of them in that way. I am using pride and arrogance as an example here but it applies to many &lsquo;negative&rsquo; personality traits as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes even after establishing that they are indeed proud and arrogant, something about it still silently defies all criticism: something like the fact that they are so utterly clueless and unaware of the flaws that you can&rsquo;t really blame them; or that they have done it so long and so often that they can&rsquo;t help themselves to behave in any other way even if they wanted to. I think we all have, to varying degrees, individual aspects of our personalities that match this description. In my opinion, it is the real definition of a flaw and it can often be beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That doesn&rsquo;t mean we shouldn&rsquo;t work on our flaws to grow and be better human beings. It just means that the road to fixing these flaws is where most of the meaning and beauty in this life can be generated. Let&rsquo;s not miss out on all the beauty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am beginning to sound like a philosopher which is probably a sign that I should stop writing lol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading!&lt;/p&gt;', 'our-imperfections-make-us-perfect_1653948793.jpeg', 1, 1, '2022-05-30 21:12:48', '2022-05-30 21:13:13', NULL),
(336, 19, 20, 'The Blood of a Prince and the Tide of Battle', 'the-blood-of-a-prince-and-the-tide-of-battle', '&lt;p&gt;Approximately three thousand years ago, a vassal state of Israel called Moab broke faith with Israel, refusing to pay the generational tribute of a hundred thousand lambs and the wool of a hundred thousand rams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reason for this rebellion by Moab is unknown to us. My guess is that Moab probably thought the then King of Israel, King Jehoram, weak, and that they could get away scot-free with refusing to pay. For all we know, they might have been right about the king of Israel being weak, but if they thought he would take their rebellion sitting down, they had another thing coming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Immediately after learning of Moab&rsquo;s rebellion, King Jehoram set out from Samaria and mobilized all Israel for war against Moab. He also made a call for alliance with the tribe of Judah, another one of Israel&rsquo;s vassal states located South of the Dead Sea. &ldquo;The king of Moab has rebelled against me,&rdquo; he wrote to King Jehoshaphat of Judah, &ldquo;will you go with me to fight against Moab?&rdquo; Jehoshaphat accepted with a pledge of his full support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plan was to march through the deserts of Edom on the South-eastern coast of the Dead Sea to get to Moab on the East; Edom herself eventually joined the alliance, making it 3 powerful nations coming for Moab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The march through the desert took 7 days. The allies were exhausted and out of water for themselves or their animals. King Jehoram was quick to blame the Lord for this shortage although I fail to see how the Lord could have been to blame for their poor planning. All the same, Prophet Elisha was consulted for answers from the Lord on this matter and the Lord was very generous in His response. Through Elisha, God promised not only to provide pools of water in the valley in which the allies had encamped but also to deliver Moab into their hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By this time, the Moabites were already aware of the approach of Israel and her allies, and had already prepared for battle in their own way. Every man, young or old, who could bear arms was armed and stationed at the border. As they observed the allied forces in the distance, the Moabites mistook the pools of water in the Israelite encampment for blood because it looked red from that distance. They came to a conclusion that the pools of &ldquo;blood&rdquo; could only mean that the allies had had a conflict and fought among themselves, slaughtering each other to the point where their blood collected into pools visible across that distance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lured by the possibility of an easy victory, they immediately abandoned the vantage position of their city walls and charged towards the encampment to finish off what remained of the allied forces. To their horror, they found the forces still fresh, united, and intact. Already face-to-face with the enemy, there was nothing more to do but fight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The allies might have been taken unawares but that didn&rsquo;t matter. The water seemed to have invigorated them and they fought fiercely, beating back the Moabites into their own lands, ravaging every fortified city, field, vegetation, and other valuables in their wake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The king of Moab, seeing that he was losing the battle, assembled what I consider to be his Special Forces unit (some 700 strong) in an attempt to cleave his way through the raging battle to get to the Edomite King. What his intentions were if he got to the Edomite King we do not know. Perhaps he wanted to ask for a parley, sue for peace, or ask for single combat; we will never know because he and his 700 failed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a second act of desperation, the Moabite king took his son &mdash; his crown Prince, and offered him up as a burned offering on the city walls, in full view of both the allied forces and his own Moabite army. The sacrifice was offered to Chemosh, the god-protector of the nation of Moab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sacrifice worked. A mighty wave of rage and indignation swept across the Moabite army after the sacrifice. They threw themselves at their enemies with savage, self-annihilating fury like underdogs who have&nbsp;nothing more to lose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this, the allies withdrew from the battle and returned to their respective homes. The Moabites retained their victory and independence for a good hundred years after that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This story raises a huge question in my mind. Clearly, the Moabites won this war. But why? Why did they win against God&rsquo;s people? God had approved of his people going to this war. He had even promised to deliver the enemy into their hands. The Israelites obeyed God meticulously throughout the battle, so we can&rsquo;t even write it off as a consequence of disobedience. And yet, the enemy won.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the heinous sacrifice, we could say that Moab was being delivered into the Israelites&rsquo; hands exactly as God had promised through Elisha. But as soon as the king of Moab sacrificed his crown Prince to Chemosh, the tide of battle turned in favor of Moab. Could a sacrifice offered to another god overturn God&rsquo;s prophecy? This would fundamentally contradict who we know God to be: He would never say He&rsquo;ll do a thing and not do it, and who dares stand between God&rsquo;s prophecy and its fulfillment? If this is all true of God, why then did the enemy win?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has been said among scholars that no one has been able to give a satisfactory answer to this question. I started writing this article because I didn&rsquo;t have a good answer and just wanted to make it an exercise in speculation. But at this point, based on all I have read in the book of 2 Kings 3, I believe I have found the answer that satisfies&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;&nbsp;at least (and I must admit that my own answer is at best a speculation). And here it is:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I believe that it is possible for the Moabites to be victorious and the Israelites undefeated. I believe that God&rsquo;s prophecy did indeed come to pass. He had not explicitly promised victory; merely that he would deliver Moab into the hands of Israel, and that He did. The Israelites didn&rsquo;t need to go out of their way to fight the moabites. The moabites came to them. It was up to the Israelites to seize their victory &mdash; which, for some reason, they decided not to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most readers assume that Israel couldn&rsquo;t stand the fury of the Moabites after the sacrifice. But it is not explicitly stated in the bible. When I read 2 Kings 3:27, it feels more like Israel, horrified by the abominable act of human sacrifice, decided to&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;abandon&lt;/em&gt;&nbsp;the battle, which is quite different from a retreat. Had they fought to the end, then I am sure victory would have been theirs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I must admit that this answer also rests on many assumptions. That scripture in the bible is highly summarized and I have a feeling that the vagueness was delibrate. Maybe God wants us to ponder deeply on the value of sacrifice especially as it keenly foreshadows the greatest sacrifice of all times, the sacrifice of His own son Jesus Christ. Maybe. We will never know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&rsquo;d like to know what you think on this matter.
